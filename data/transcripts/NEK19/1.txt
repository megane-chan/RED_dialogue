Nastya: Maybe there…

Dasha: //Yes, at the table…

Zhenya: //[UI]

Nastya: We need hoodies that zip all the way down… Because it’s awkward like this…//[UI]

Natasha: //Yes, that would be cool… I think with time we got used to them… Where there are holes, where they need a button…

Dasha: There are no buttons.

Nastya: Okay, come on, what’s up?





01:30

Alik: //We’ll wait… or are you still listening?

Zhenya: No, I’m already done… //What? We don’t have to?

Alik: //Not anymore.

Natasha: //I still need to plug in my mic…

Alik: Mhm.

Nastya: Where do we log in?

Alik: “Project Red Design”

Nastya: Ah, I see…

Dasha to Alik: And we Log in as?

Natasha: It’s loading.

Alik: Ah… now, wait. There are Log ins in each folder, passwords and so on… No, on this paper. In your folder. On the first page …

03:30

Nastya to Natasha: //Are you going to give me a folder too then?

Alik: There is your name and password.

Dasha: I have the exact same folder.

Natasha: Materials is here…

Alik to Natasha: //That’s me: materials. Give it to me, please.

Natasha: Operation… Just a second…

Nastya to Alik: No, that’s mine. Operation.

Natasha to Alik: Yes, this is Operation, and this is Materials.

Ryan: Yes.

05:02

Zhenya: So, this here…

Nastya: In which chat box?

Alik: On the bottom. This chat box. On the left, this window.

Nastya: Yes, but you need to choose.

Alik to Nastya: Choose, yes. Choose whom you will write to.

 



Nastya to Alik: How do we choose?

Alik to Nastya: //There on the left, choose whom you want to write to.

06:01

Nastya to Alik: No, well, based on what?

Natasha: //Yeah.

Alik: Well, from your team.

Dasha: //Who is in connect, right?

Natasha: A here, for example, I can write to Dasha. Can’t I?

Zhenya: And what do we write? OK? Can we write OK?

Alik:  You can write OK. Or Ready.

Natasha: And will everyone read it or just the recipient?

Dasha: Only the person you send it to.

Alik: …Yes, the one you send it to, //will be reading it.

Natasha: Well, shall we check, Dasha? I’m writing to you.

Dasha: Okay. And I wrote to a Chicagoan. Oh, and he answered me. //[UI]

06:42

Zhenya: Ok, I wrote. That’s it.

Nastya: And I can only write to my own group?

Alik: Actually you can’t write to the group.

Dasha: No, why? Everyone // in the group can.




Natasha: To our own group, we can. We just checked that. Yes, I remember.

Dasha: Ah, but the Chicagoans answered me.

Zhenya: What? What did they answer me? // Who did I write to?

07:13

Alik: //Okay, do we have contact?

Dasha: Yes, we do.

Nastya: //So who do we write to? Our own group or not?

Natasha: We wrote to our own group.

Alik: Nastya, we only have one [UI] here write to the sedimentologist that we are ready.

Natasha to Dasha: //We have the second one, I think, biomechanical engineer, right?

Alik to Nastya: //I think her name is Valeria, If I’m not mistaken.

Dasha: Ah, our beauty?

Alik: Well, there were photos…

07:39

Alik to Ryan: [SL] Do we have their contact?

Ryan: Yes.

Alik: Yeah? Ok.

Zhenya: They wrote “hello” to me, is that okay?

Alik: Did she go [UI]?

Nastya: //[UI] [Transcriber’s note: I think she used the work “fuck” based on the following conversation]

Natasha: They didn’t give me anything…

Dasha: Whoa…




Alik: Igor hears all.

Zhenya: //He isn’t paying attention.

Ryan: //All six of us have voice recorders.

Natasha: I said it. We need to find a Russian word that sounds like it.

Nastya: That is…

Dasha: “Fakultativ” [elective]

Natasha: “Fakultativnoye zanyatiye” [elective course]

08:09

Ryan: Well appreciated.

Natasha: No big deal.

Nastya: [UI]…

Dasha: That’s it. Let it go.

Ryan: No problem.

Alik: //Correct.

Nastya: I was working with commander and we were expecting this kind of [UI]…

Zhenya: Yes, a swearer and [UI]

Nastya to Ryan: I’m sorry. I mean no more swearing.

Alik: [UI]…

Zhenya: //Oh, I found Russian.

08:39

Nastya: Nobody answers me now!

Natasha: No one is answering me either…




Nastya: They aren’t even writing from my own group.

Zhenya: //No one answers swearers.

Natasha: //Well let’s write to some others here… Do we have a drill specialist?

Nastya: Oh, they answered me…

Natasha: Drilling specialist…

Alik: That’s on our team. It’s actually Valera, who is there…

Dasha: [UI]…

Natasha: Valera…

Alik: Valeria…

Dasha: //Valera… Valera.

Nastya to Alik: //Will they listen to these recordings after or when?

Alik: I don’t know about the recordings. Everything is being recorded right now.

09:08

Nastya: Yes, but… what about Valeria and?

Alik: And the most important thing is how we //perform this task in five minutes.

Natasha: // And to biomechanical engineer… Shall we start with those? Oh, they also wrote to me…

Zhenya: Hello. They wrote that a long time //ago.

Alik: //Ours still aren’t answering…

Zhenya: I also have this red thing hanging here. Here on the page.

Dasha: That’s a letter for you…

Natasha: That means a letter arrived.

Zhenya: Can I look at it?




Natasha: //Yes.

Zhenya: //Just like that… Everyone is writing to the colonel.

Natasha: //Someone wrote first…

Dasha: [UI]

Zhenya: Hydrogeologist hello.

Ryan: Good afternoon.

09:38

Dasha: //Why can’t I see who I wrote to… [UI]?

Natasha: // [SL] Frank… hello, [SL] Frank… We don’t have to write to everyone, right?

Alik: Just write “hello” and that’s it…

Natasha: Yes, I… I think I’m done greeting everyone.

Zhenya: And I can also write “yes’…

Natasha: You can also write “good” and “OK.”

Dasha to Alik: And what is “preference”?

Alik: Preference.

Zhenya: Oh, are you already choosing a restaurant over there? Preference…

Alik: [UI] 

10:08

Dasha: I have contact!

Natasha: So, what next?

Alik: //Solve the problem.

Nastya: [UI]




Natasha: So, where do we go?

Alik: Let’s look at what we need to do to perform the task. Find an optimal position for a well and select the //appropriate parameters…

Natasha: //Where do we go now? Sign off or…

Alik: There, someone is going to the bathroom…

Dasha: I already went. Are you saying I’m some kind of improper… //[UI]

10:35

Nastya to Ryan: What to do next?

Ryan: You wanna find somewhere that minimizes your cost so… //look through the grid.

Natasha: //Do we need to click anything here? [UI]?

Ryan: //Locate something… and then there is decision calculator on the right… It’ll be price. At some point you’ll have to choose certain criteria…

Dasha: Are there no smileys here?

Natasha: Last time we filled out some big survey. Will we do that now?

11:05

Alik: Yes, right after the forty-five minutes there will be a survey. This [SL] D Church eight.

Natasha: //Ah, no not [SL] D Church, but you need to fill this out here…

Ryan: //No, no… only one time…

Zhenya: //Ah, like the first time, right?

Natasha: //[UI]

Dasha: Ryan, what are you doing right now?... You picked any point? Just any spot, right?

Nastya: //Well, without a date there you can…

Ryan: //[UI]




Dasha: Any point, right? //You picked at random, right?

Ryan: //Yes, any one…

Zhenya: And do I need to place all of them too?

Ryan to Zhenya: //Any one… here…

11:36

Zhenya: Just like that here…

Ryan: Scroll.

Zhenya: That’s it. Mine isn’t working…

Natasha: We figured that out quick…

Dasha: Huh?

Natasha: We figured something out quickly…

12:05

Zhenya: //But I don’t have…

Alik: //Solving the whole problem is another question.

Natasha: And… what?

Dasha: And what?

Ryan to Zhenya: You see here…

Nastya: Well what? I chose location… Darn, I think… well, fine.

12:33

Natasha: Last time we had questions and it was clear what to look for and where… to choose…

Dasha: What is murky?

Alik: What?




Dasha: Murky.

Alik: Murky means murky.

Dasha: Murky?

Alik: Yes, murky…

Natasha: [UI]

13:07

Dasha: Is it right that first the boys had to work to find a place. Then they picked the best place. Then Stephania and I went after them and started choosing more or less appropriate materials. And then the guys with robots came and cleaned up after everyone.

Natasha: Logically, yes, but //apparently, they want it in parallel.

Dasha: [UI]

Natasha: So, this will be counted on its own… this one is…

13:39

Dasha: Which one do we fill out?

Zhenya: Mine isn’t working…

Natasha: [UI]

Zhenya: But he doesn’t see me… Ah, found it?

Ryan: [UI]

Zhenya: [UI]

Nastya: No, well, we just need to, yes //[UI]?

Ryan: //we just found a place… so…//Start…it’s here… Then how do you say selections?








14:18

Alik: Selections.

Zhenya: Selections.

Ryan: You need to choose… then… just here // [UI]

Dasha:  //I placed a point, I looked, does… that work for me or no? What do I do now?

Ryan: Start…there is one… and one more… place// [UI]

Nastya: //[UI]

14:46

Nastya: //[UI]

Alik: //[UI]

Ryan: … need to choose… //there

Nastya: We did that a long time ago…

Alik: I don’t have it. It kicks me out immediately for some reason… //See, I am material. Here it says Logged in [UI]. //See, in a minute or two it will kick me out again. //There, see, it kicked me…

Nastya: //[UI]

Dasha: //And you, maybe…

Alik: //And I can’t… //It kicked me out again. That’s the third time.

Ryan to Zhenya: // [UI]

15:18

Dasha to Zhenya: //Did you Log in correctly …

Alik: I did it right… It says right here…

All: //[UI]





Ryan to Zhenya: //And… check… page

Zhenya: //Ok, ok…

Alik: Yes, that is a problem. //I don’t understand at all…

Zhenya to Alik: //What?

Dasha: //Ryan, what should we do?

Alik: // [UI] with Valeria there… //we can’t log in to the same account…

Dasha to Ryan: //There, for example, this place…

15:48

Ryan: Good.

Natasha: [UI] need to log in…

Nastya: Wait A…//I No, we should choose the location. M-A-G…

Alik: MAG team… //their team should pick the place and then we start working.

Nastya: //Yes, yes…

Nastya: Therefore, MAG will send the specific location you will be working on for forty-five minutes.

Natasha: So, the point we placed, //for now we can remove it or what?

Dasha: //You can’t…

Nastya: Yeah, don’t do that… They should send us a location.

16:23

Ryan: [UI]

Alik: I’ll be right back. I need to call Igor.

Ryan to Dasha: // [UI]






Nastya: Ryan, Ryan, MAG will provide the location, not us.

Ryan: Okay, so we just…

Nastya: Wait. I mean… this is session two, right? Session two…

Ryan: Yeah, so they’re gonna…

Nastya: So here is what we can…

16:53

Nastya: There is one way five minutes communication delay between crew and MAG, therefore MAG will send the specific location you will be working on for forty-five minutes [UI] going back and forth discussions between locations.

Ryan: This can be number one. Because that last time it was just the training session… We have number one here?

Nastya: No… It’s session two…

17:24

Ryan: But that’s Mission eight twenty-eight… that’s not what we need… Session one is Mission eight five… so communication delay… So, we are working with them right now. So, once we have the time delay that’s when we choose. Or when they choose.

Natasha: //We still choose…

Nastya: So, what is it? [SL] MG five?

Ryan: Right.

Natasha: We still //pick the point, right?

Ryan: //[UI]

18:00

Dasha: What is this?

Ryan: The survey.

Zhenya: Wow…



Natasha: Ryan…

Dasha: Well, how should I know, huh?

Ryan: // [UI]

Natasha: //Ryan, which specialist are you?

Ryan: Hm?

Natasha: Which specialist are you? What kind of specialist?

Ryan: Meteorology

Natasha: Minerology?

Zhenya: Meteorologist.

Natasha: Ah, meteorologist…

Zhenya: And what do we need to do here?... //Question?

18:29

Natasha to Zhenya: Ah yes, pick a specialist that you… This is about them, yes, the first or what?... Ah… Who do you rely on for leadership? //[translating the question] //[UI]

Dasha to Ryan: //So, I don’t like you…

Ryan and Dasha: //[UI]

Nastya to Natasha: //Ryan is meteorologist?

Natasha: // Ryan is meteorologist…

Dasha to Ryan: Allowed – not allowed.

18:58

Natasha: …//So… ok…

Dasha: [UI]… OK, yes.

Natasha: Next: [translating the question] Who do you like working with?



Zhenya: Mhm… //oh, that’s it.

Natasha: //But again, why did it [UI]?

Zhenya: So, source information. Which of… Or this actually “Which of the available…” This one: “Which of the available…”?

Natasha: … [UI]

19:31

Natasha: Well, I think it’s this // [translating the question] “Who is an information resource”

Ryan: //[UI]

Zhenya to Natasha: //For me?

Natasha to Zhenya: //Yes.

Dasha: //[UI]

Zhenya: //[UI]

Dasha to Ryan: And what do we do next?

20:01

Ryan: …to do… [UI]

Natasha: [UI]It is probably strange that they are writing to Ryan. He is not on our team [UI]

Zhenya: What to do? I can also pick myself.

Dasha: Yes, I praised myself.

Zhenya: Wait, where is…

Natasha: The main thing in a good question. //There are more [UI]

20:32

Dasha: //Is there another one like that? And how did you…? Oh, madhouse.





Zhenya: So, and… lea-der-ship is what?

Alik: //Leadership.

Natasha: //That is who you trust…

Zhenya: //I trust Ryan…

Natasha: //[UI]

Dasha: Ryan is our star.

Ryan: //[UI]

Natasha: //Ah, look…

Alik: //They say they trust you.

Natasha: Guys.

Alik: Yes.

21:00

Natasha: Structural geologist:- The amount of available water is [SL] very low. This means in the place that I selected, I can expect very… //no water.

Dasha: //No, the one, well… I wrote.

Natasha to Dasha: Ah, you wrote them something…

Dasha to Natasha: There, [SL] two engineers: thirty-nine twenty-four.

Natasha: So…

Dasha to Natasha: //The message is higher.

Natasha: // Can you check twenty-three forty-nine [UI]

Zhenya: So, who is creating this problem? This one //[UI] this is no one.

Ryan to Zhenya: //No one, yeah.

Dasha to Natasha: Did you write anything?



Natasha : I did to mechanical engineer.

21:29

Dasha: I understand, I see that you wrote [SL] “good luck.” Before this.

Natasha: //And this in this chat //[UI]

Ryan: //[UI]

Alik: //That does not solve the problem.

Ryan: //Now you’re on your own out there. Have fun.

Zhenya: Figure it out…

Natasha: They are writing to me //[UI]

Nastya: [UI] // already made it to America…

Alik: //Don’t forget how they write there…

Nastya: …you already don’t know…

Zhenya: Which of you here works most effectively? //Meteorology and terrain…

22:00

Natasha: Can you check twenty-three forty-nine…

Nastya: //I have everything here. Now what do I do?

Alik to Nastya: Have we received anything from our …?

Dasha: //Work…

Nastya to Alik: No, nothing has come.

Alik to Nastya: Is she playing with us or something?... //Well, does it work?

Zhenya: //Personal dislike.

Ryan to Nastya: What are you? What task are you? Or what person are you?




Nastya: I’m operation specialist.

Ryan: So, you’ll see your designed goal in the page?

Nastya: Yeah.

Ryan: What are they?

Nastya: Here

22:29

Natasha: I don’t know why my message was deleted… Maybe I shouldn’t be in this chat at all?

Dasha to Natasha: She’s crazy about chatting. She’s writing everywhere!

Alik: [UI]

Zhenya: //Wait for the text message. It will be fine there… Okay, I finished, I think.

Alik: Zhenya, that’s the third time you’ve said that…

Zhenya: Ah there, it came again.

Alik: //Don’t rush.

Natasha: Twenty-three forty-nine.

Zhenya: So…// We have // thirty minutes remaining…// and what is this?...

Ryan to Nastya: //Which one are you?

Nastya to Ryan: //Operation specialist.

23:00

Zhenya: //We have thirty minutes remaining.

Alik: //Yes, thirty minutes…// In forty-five minutes this will close, and we will answer the questions.

Ryan to Nastya: //[UI]






Dasha: //I don’t understand. I can’t work if I have no idea what to do.

Zhenya: So, if they wrote to me that we have thirty minutes, does that mean we’re done?

Ryan to Nastya: Ok you need to talk. You need to make a question anywhere you can in here.

Zhenya: //So that’s bad?

23:26

Ryan to Nastya: //And then there is a checkmark on the [UI] and that should keep you off. What you are trying to do is to find the location that will cost you as low as possible. But you need, in order to do that you need to make all of those choices.

Alik and Dasha: [UI]

Ryan to Zhenya: And for calculate you can choose all or you can…

Dasha to Alik: But what is this?

Alik to Dasha: Well, this spot [UI]

Dasha: And how am I supposed to choose, it’s his anyway? This engineer.

Ryan: [UI]

24:00

Dasha: He wants it in English.

Alik to Dasha: Well, take a look.

Dasha: Well, here it’s in English, and here Russian.

Alik: Ah, I see.

Dasha: I can’t get the letters right… Do you have English there or Russian?... Ah, you probably have it set up for yourself, right?... I have hydroengineer…

Natasha: Twenty-three…

Ryan: // [UI]

Zhenya to Ryan: You guess… you guess it… mhm.



24:32

All: //[UI]

Ryan: Terrain [UI] Operational…

All: //[UI]

Ryan: Done. Oh, yes… We need…

Zhenya: To reduce it.

Ryan: To reduce it, yes.

25:01

Zhenya: Ah, it won’t become [UI], right?

Dasha: [UI]

Alik to Nastya: Terrain specialist. She answered… //Did you see? Just not us. She answered the geologists…

Nastya: Mhm.

Alik to Nastya: And you have, I think, there is a little wheel.

Nastya to Alik: Yes, I marked it…

Alik: //You will see…

Natasha: There, now I’m also in the wheel…

Dasha to Natasha: //Well, naturally, and see how you wrote ”good luck” before this?

Natasha: //Ah there there, I see now… //It just appeared for me.

Alik: //I don’t see “good luck.”

Dasha: Ah, seriously?

Natasha: //Mhm…//Thirty-nine twenty-four.





25:32

Ryan to Zhenya: [UI]

Dasha to Alik: //I got a message back… here see, twenty-three twenty-four…

Ryan to Zhenya: //[UI] checkmark [UI]

Alik to Dasha: //No, here are just all the messages…

Alik: Nastya, what is this?

Nastya: They sent me a message from human factor that [SL] in one location [SL] there was an explosion. [SL]Do we have any wish to coordinate?

Alik: Are they asking us? Well, that’s not your job.

Nastya: Well, I… //yes.

Alik: You are Operation specialist.

Nastya: //Well I also have to type in the coordinates now… and…//give the technical characteristics…

26:06

Dasha to Ryan: [UI] this here…

Ryan to Dasha: Spinning…

Dasha: Well, this drives me crazy…

Alik: No big deal… 

Ryan to Dasha: This needs to be higher.

Dasha to Ryan: Higher is better?

Ryan to Dasha: Hm, I don’t know.

Dasha to Ryan: I didn’t take everything there. There is no…

Alik: [translating to Ryan]





Ryan: Mhm //[UI]

26:38

Dasha: There, see, here you need allowed…

Ryan:  Need allowed…

Dasha: What should it be made of? What [SL] plastic should I make? No no, let me think, wait!

Ryan: [SL]It’s a mystery.

Dasha: No, why [SL] plastic?

Ryan: You need…

Dasha: To make more?

Ryan: More. Yes yes yes.

Dasha: //[UI]

Ryan: Structural geologist… Try that…

Alik: Ah, he says try //twenty-three forty-nine.

Dasha: //There, that’s what I’m doing. Twenty-three forty-nine is already here.

Ryan: //[UI]

Alik to Dasha: But you got all the data, right?

Dasha: Well, I will try twenty-three forty-nine, but… now I need…

27:08

Ryan: Cheaper…

Alik to Dasha: Play with these numbers. Look at the different combinations you can make.

Dasha: Why should I do it blindly if I have…






Alik: Not blindly. You have the main goals, specific tasks. You aren’t blind. We each have a specific assignment.

Natasha: //Here we need to catch up a bit…

Ryan: You wanna reach the most amount of people with the least amount of cost, right?

Alik: Yes. What job do you have?

Dasha: Me – hydroengineer.

Alik: Hydroengineer…

Ryan: //[UI]

27:34

Natasha: Generally, one additional watt equals one additional gallon per hour. But this is a [UI] if the water source is no more than one foot deep. How should we understand this logic?

Nastya: //[UI]

Alik: //[UI]

Natasha: So, one watt is equal to one gallon and… but that depends on extraction…

Alik: Where do we get this water?

Natasha: On… feet, water is in feet, which tells us how deep it is // situated.

Alik: Ah, yes.

28:05

Alik: At what depth it’s at.

Natasha: If I have, let’s say, a water reserve detected at four thousand…

Zhenya: No difference…//it’s a good reserve.

Natasha: That means… That means I should have four thousand watts or no?






Alik: Is that their ratio? One to one?

Natasha: One to one watts to gallons per hour. But we don’t have information on gallons per hour…

28:34

Alik: You mean gallons per hour and depth? Those are different things.

Natasha: Here I have one watt is equal to one gallon per hour. But that is a [UI] if the water…

Alik: At that depth, right?

Natasha: The water source is no more than one foot deep.

Alik: Oh, so where is water like that?

Natasha: Well, here I have water at four thousand feet.

Alik: One foot is thirty centimeters… The water will be much deeper than thirty centimeters.

29:03

Natasha: Four thousand… but how do we calculate from that… this wattage, watts?

Alik: Hm, is that all yours?

Natasha: Well yes, it’s mine.

Alik: Well, I think the kind of place that was chosen and at what depth the water is located from here and… //What depth and how many watts there.

Natasha: [UI] Are they equal, you think?

29:31

Alik: Well, they’re saying if it’s at a depth… No deeper than one foot. So, no deeper than thirty centimeters… basically on the surface.

Natasha: A lot of time is still going towards testing. It’s so slow. [UI]








30:03

Alik: Zhenya, you’re the meteorologist, right?

Zhenya: No, I am terrain. Ryan is the meteorologist.

Alik: Have you already completed your tasks?

Zhenya: I don’t know. I already answered twice. I answered the second round of questions. Apparently, that’s good. That’s how I feel.

Alik: Promising signs…

Nastya: //[UI]

Ryan: Oh, Zhenya…

30:34

Zhenya: Yeah, you all should look at the prices. //[UI] three and six hundred. //I’m impressed…

Dasha: //[UI]

Nastya: I have sixty total… perforation cost… so everything is fine… [UI]

Natasha: //Where are you looking?

Alik: //[UI]

Nastya: Go up, there are [SL] related powers.

Natasha: I don’t even think I have a graph like that.

31:03

Nastya:  I found one and a half thousand depth… for water.

Natasha: //[UI]

Dasha: //I chose thirty-three twenty-nine.

Zhenya: //Well, I still need to find a place…

Alik to Dasha: //And what questions did you have? These?



Dasha: Yes.

Alik: Constantly?

Dasha: Two times.

Alik: For me it’s every two minutes.

Natasha: Maybe here I need to take…

Dasha: //[UI]

31:31

Dasha: You’re like //[UI]

Alik: Just isn’t worth a damn //to the Chicagoans…

Dasha: I feel like an idiot… I remember seeing temperatures like this somewhere… when we did…//yes.

Alik: //Well, we were solving problems for training.

Dasha: And where can we find this information on temperatures now?

Zhenya: //You should have memorized it…

Dasha: //[UI] We need to push away from them…

Natasha: //Well, I understand, this here is for Ryan…

32:02

Ryan: Are any of those things [UI]?

Zhenya: Oh, they even sent a message…

Alik: That’s good.

Ryan: Twenty-three forty-nine…

Zhenya: //[UI]

Ryan to Zhenya:  Twenty-three forty-nine…



Zhenya: //Ah, enter…

Alik: //[UI]

Ryan to Zhenya: //[UI]

32:32

Ryan: //[UI]

Dasha: //[UI] counted the coordinates?

Natasha to Dasha: Hydroengineer, did you pick anything?// For point forty-three forty-nine?

Zhenya to Ryan: //[UI]

Dasha: I’m picking now.

Natasha: [SL] pipe materials //[UI]

Dasha: //Yes yes.

Natasha: //And biomechanic is ours…

Ryan: Which source… then.

Zhenya: Ah, ok…

Ryan: //[UI] choose…

Zhenya: Ok, ok.

33:01

Dasha: I feel like I’m getting stupider, no?

Zhenya: I don’t know where you’re getting that from…

Dasha: I found the temperature!

Zhenya: //No, that temperature found you…






Dasha: //No, I think… wait… //just a sec, wait…

Alik: //Dasha will win now…

Zhenya: You’ll beat…

Dasha: Me? Wait. Just a second.

Zhenya: //Everyone.

Alik: //She can’t find something…

Dasha: //No, it’s in English here…

Natasha: I understand how to enter this part, but I don’t understand the physics logic of the calculation. This is torque and watts… This is how you calculate the depth of a reserve, watts and torque.

33:40

Nastya: Do you see there twenty-three forty-nine at all? They had a stone layer there, so it’s not the best one to drill.

Natasha: I’m not allowed to copy anything, right? //Yet…

Alik: //Oh, maintenance told you it was okay…

Natasha: Who?

Alik: Nastya.

Ryan: //twenty-three forty-nine

Alik to Nastya: Are you the maintenance specialist?

Alik: Me? I am materials.

Nastya: And who is maintenance?

Alik: I don’t know who maintenance is.

Nastya: And what does “population reached the…” mean?





34:07

Alik: That means this water will reach a very small number of people.

Nastya: Ah, but…

Natasha: //[UI]

Alik: //So it will be a waste…

Dasha: So, some kind of tabs are opening for me…

34:40

Natasha: Dang, messages take so long to appear for me…

Zhenya: So, and… should have also entered…

35:13

Alik: That means this is thirty-six…

Natasha: She wrote. Biomechanical engineer. Later you’ll just see the correspondence.

Dasha: We aren’t there yet… If only we could figure this out… [UI] 
 
Ryan: So…

Alik: What?

Ryan: You’ll have [UI]. You’ll have //different specialist there.

Dasha: //So, I selected. Now what do I do?

Natasha: Yeah, I have the same question. Do I click the checkmark or what? After we entered all the data. Or can we state it and Dasha and I can run shared data in parallel?

Ryan to Alik: //Translate

Alik: // [translating the question to Ryan] She is asking: when she picks the channel, does she hit the checkmark on the right side or [UI]

Dasha to Natasha: //I can’t see if anyone wrote anything to me, so I didn’t run anything. //I don’t have anything, it doesn’t show any message…

00:32

Ryan: //As as… [UI] for location and calculation [UI]

Natasha: //[UI] on the triangle…





Dasha: //[UI]

Alik to Natasha: The checkmark just shows that you like this place…

Ryan: Not like saving… like saving location…

Natasha: Okay, if I want to, here, calculate my data? I put my data. What next?

Ryan: You’ll look through the track to see if there are any new coordinates…

Natasha: No new coordinates.

00:58

Ryan: …being discussed. And then, if there are, you can go in and check. Otherwise you can communicate with specialists in the right. //Ask them what they are putting…

Natasha: //Like our biomechanical engineer, mhm…

Dasha: What do you mean, Ryan, I should climb over here to the mechanical engineer, I removed it here…  [UI]

01:27

Nastya: Zhenya, give me some water, please.

Zhenya: Water? What, got dry mouth?

Dasha: Somewhere in the calculation I took a new save. What should I do with it? //How can I work with it from here?

Alik: Well, if you took it, you can look at it, agree or disagree…

Dasha to Natasha: Do you see my selections there…?

Natasha: No… I don’t see yours. That’s why I thought we had to state them, like, to their team [UI]. Or write it in the chat? I am trying to say this in the chat right now.

01:57

Dasha: I’ll write that now too… Dangit, I’m also going to… Hey, Zhenya, did you pour her some water? [UI]

Ryan to Nastya: //Are you operational specialist? Are you operations?



Alik to Dasha: //Come on, go go…

Dasha to Alik: //No. That’s from the attack here…

Ryan to Nastya: You found a stone layer?

Nastya to Ryan: Yeah…twenty…yeah,// the location [SL] fourteen [UI]

Dasha to Alik: //[UI]

Alik: //Yeah, there’s no one there…

02:29

Dasha: So…

Alik: [UI]

Nastya to Ryan: Well that’s what it shows me that there is a stone layer.

Dasha to Natasha: And what does yours look like there?

Natasha to Dasha: //Hmm, and six… I’m not in the chat.

Dasha: //No, why? You are.// You wrote something…

Natasha to Dasha: //[UI]

Nastya to Ryan: I’m not sure if I have to do the pumps. Maybe?

Ryan to Nastya: They are not right, so it is.

Dasha to Natasha: See the message?

02:58

Natasha to Dasha: Well, I see that there is a message, but I can’t read it, because I have two hundred questions… And it’s working slow… [UI]… I am trying to write now…

Nastya to Ryan: Also water source, water [UI] is quite far on the //[UI]







Ryan: [UI]

03:28

Nastya to Ryan: My location is [UI]

Ryan to Nastya: What location?

Nastya to Ryan: Thirty-nine twenty-three. Although someone said that it’s too far to reach for people… But, not all… 

Ryan to Nastya: You’re gonna have to go to change [UI]

Zhenya: Oh, they wrote something to me. Thirty minutes “lift.”

Alik: “left” – remaining,

Zhenya: //Ah, why are they writing that to me?

Alik: //Why are they writing the time to you?

Zhenya: I don’t know.

Dasha to Zhenya: Are you going to make more coffee?

Zhenya: Of course I will. Coffee is all I can do.

03:58

Dasha: For three.

Zhenya: Yes.

Alik: Zhenya is sweating even…

Dasha: I see your eyebrows are wet…

Zhenya: Yes… Why are they counting the time, dangit?

Alik: They are only writing it to you…

Dasha: I get stuff, but I don’t see the messages that arrive. Only //[UI]

Alik: It seems different people have different chats.



All: //[UI]

04:27

Alik to Nastya: Are you corresponding with our Valeria?

Nastya: //Well, I wrote to her about how it’s going… But I only received one cost.

Natasha: [UI] …And I am sending it to you right now, Dasha. [UI]… And [SL] Couper, do you have it like this in the first graph?

Dasha to Natasha: Well, yes.

04:56

Natasha to Dasha: You have two graphs, I think, right?

Dasha to Natasha: Yes, forty-seven…

Natasha to Dasha: And just [SL] Couper. Why forty-seven? I only have [SL] Couper that’s it.

Dasha to Natasha: And the second graph?

Natasha: Ah, [SL] Couper… forty-seven repeats. And [UI]

Alik: [SL] Couper forty-seven. What isn’t clear here?

Dasha to Natasha:  Well, you surprise me… So how many? Five //That many?

Nastya to Alik: //Maintenance…

Alik to Nastya: //And where is he? //Did he write to you?

Natasha : I don’t know, honestly. //I couldn’t calculate it. I need to somehow apply… //Some kind of efforts.

05:29

Alik to Nastya: Does he want something?

Nastya : Meteorology //[UI]

Ryan: //[UI]




Natasha: //They write: One watt equals one gallon per hour of water. Hear that, Dasha?

Dasha: //Who are they? Who are we talking about?

Natasha: Well about this… This watt. To calculate watts, watts… //really, you can have a watt value from ten to five hundred thousand.

Nastya to Ryan: //[UI]

Natasha: So, to calculate watts, one watt is equal to one gallon per hour. But that still depends on…

05:59

Natasha: This…//that’s true if the water is only one-foot underground. And I, frankly, don’t fully understand how that is… I don’t understand at all how that is…

Alik to Natasha: So, basically on the surface. There, one foot.

Natasha: Well, yes. So, if the water is on the surface, we need one watt to get one gallon per hour. //But in our case water is…

Alik to Natasha: //Someone needs to confirm how deep the water is here.

Natasha: We know. The water is at four thousand.

06:29

Alik: What?

Natasha: Well, feet, apparently.

Alik: Well that’s not one foot. That is very deep.

Natasha: Four thousand, yes. Accordingly, if the water is that deep, that means our watt values will be very high.

Alik: Yes.

Dasha to Natasha: Did you write in this, in our chat with this girl… ?

Natasha: I wrote my data.

Dasha: And did I write my data?




Alik: //Ah, Nastya, she is writing to us //[UI]

Dasha: //[UI]

Natasha: //[UI] twenty-three forty-nine…

Alik: Drilling wrote  to us…

06:58

Natasha: //Dangit, how do you write that…

Alik: Twenty-three forty-five… well, let’s try it.

Nastya to Alik: Ah, do you mean?...

Alik to Nastya: Did you write to her?

Nastya to Alik: //I wrote that there was…//[UI]

Natasha: //Ryan, [SL] “yep.” E Y P?

Nastya to Alik: //[UI]

Ryan: Hm?

Natasha: //[SL] “yep,” [SL] “yep.” E Y P?  

Ryan: Yes.

Alik to Nastya: Did you write her that?

Nastya: Yes.

Alik: And she is still asking?

Dasha: //Ah here I found it… //[UI]

Natasha to Dasha: And she is asking which is twenty-three forty-nine among them?

Dasha: Yes.






07:29

Natasha: //[UI]

Alik: Fine, we’ll try… //[UI]

Natasha: //I feel like this is all wrong…

Dasha to Natasha: It looks like there is a delay here. I am reading… You already discussed this, right? I just saw it.

Natasha to Dasha: Yes, but I. And… And I am sending it, it disappears and only reappears after a minute.

Nastya to Alik: [UI]

Alik to Nastya: “pump” is “pump.”

Nastya: Yes yes, but who is counting that?

Dasha: //That is biomechanical engineer.

Alik: Yes yes, that’s not us.

07:59

Natasha: //That is me.

Nastya to Natasha: That is you?

Natasha: I count pumps. Yes.

Nastya to Natasha: And you said that watts… One watt for a thousand feet?

Natasha to Nastya: No, for one. Here. I have all the information here.

Zhenya: //They told me a long time ago: thirty minutes…

Natasha to Nastya: //Generally, one additional watt…

Zhenya: //I think I should write “nine minutes left.”

Natasha to Nastya: //[UI] so, to lift one gallon of water per hour, you need one watt. That’s if the water is at a depth of one foot. So, here you need to apply some logic.



08:30

Natasha to Nastya: So the watts should go up. The deeper you go, the more watts. The more water, the more watts.

Alik: //[UI]

Nastya to Natasha: Well, by how much is it…?

Natasha to Nastya: I can’t do this… “The Maintenance specialist should have this message” …Who is the Maintenance specialist here?

Nastya: We don’t have one.

Ryan: That’s in Chicago.

Natasha: Great, the message… should have that message //[UI]

Nastya to Zhenya: //An apricot, please…

Dasha: And what does this mean?

09:00

Natasha: I don’t know, be she writes “great!”… she writes “great!”…//That means good.

Dasha: And will she tell us her information [SL] on the filter?

Natasha: …I don’t know… //Where she is here…

Zhenya: //She doesn’t tell secrets.

Alik: //This here, then…

Natasha: //Maintenance…

Alik: [UI]

09:30

Dasha: //[UI]

Alik: [UI]




Natasha: And here I see they wrote and wrote.

Dasha: Where are they writing?

Natasha: Here, actually in maintenance… “Hello, please confirm when the crew is in [UI] need to be closed together. Maintenance cost very high [UI]”

Dasha: They are writing to me… //[UI]

09:59

Natasha to Dasha: They told you that you wrote cool. //But not me…

Dasha: I told you how I fumbled until the end, but…

Natasha: Very high.

Alik: Very high.

Natasha: Very high.// [UI]

Dasha: //When are we done?

Alik: //I don’t know…

Natasha: //[UI]

Zhenya: //[UI]

Dasha: When are we done? My eyes are going blurry…

Nastya to Zhenya: Why are you here anyway?

Zhenya: //They periodically inform me of how much time is left.

Alik: //They know whom to write about the time…

Zhenya: Who is keeping time…

10:28

Dasha to Zhenya: Are you eating sunflower seeds or something?

Zhenya: Yes… That’s it, they stopped writing… Apparently, they understood who they’re talking to.



Alik: //They said hello and that’s enough.

Dasha to Natasha: Oh, look. An answer came about the filters.

Natasha: Yeah?

Dasha: Yes.

Natasha: What is it?

Dasha: Well, in our correspondence. I asked her, and she answered.

Natasha: We can do, for example…

Dasha: No, not that…

Natasha: Fifty thousand…

Dasha to Natasha: What are you changing there? We had an agreement.

10:59

Natasha: And they are saying too high…

Dasha: Ah, they told you they were //high?

Natasha: //Yes, they say that is too high.

Dasha: I don’t see that. Where did they tell you? I don’t understand!

Natasha: //They said the lowest one…

Alik to Dasha: //They just complimented you…

Dasha: //I saw that they are complimenting me. //But I didn’t see…

Natasha: //The lowest…

Dasha: What?

Zhenya: //They are complimenting Dasha to calm her down…

Alik: That’s different…




Natasha: Fifty and…//[UI]

Zhenya: //I just keep the time.

11:27

Dasha to Zhenya: You should write them back: “what about the time?”

Zhenya: In Russian.

Dasha: Yes, in Russian too. They write everything in…

Dasha: How do you say “abbreviation?” …How?

Alik: What?

Dasha: Ah, “thank you.” T-H-R-X? //[UI]

Zhenya: //Oh, five minutes left.

Alik: T-H-X is the short version of “thanks.”

Dasha: Yeah?

Alik: Yes, yes. That’s the shortest.

12:00

Dasha: So just three letters?

Alik: //Yes, that’s the shortest.

Zhenya: “Six minutes remaining” – that’s until the end?

Dasha: //[UI]

Alik: Zhenya, don’t worry. Everything will be fine.

Zhenya: I’m not worried at all. They are informing you all. If I only knew why they were writing to me… //I’m totally [UI]

Alik to Dasha: “Will it work?” – she is asking.

Dasha: How am I supposed to know if it will work or not for me?



Alik: //Well, then we need to check.

Dasha: She’s so interesting! Madam…

12:31

Alik: Maybe it’s not a madam.

Dasha: No, well, it’s definitely a madam.

Natasha: They are writing to me: “good,” smiley, smiley.

Dasha: And what did you answer them?

Natasha: Ah, I’ll copy you now.

Alik: She is the head of the chat. She made friends with everyone in the chat.

Natasha: I’m just asking //[UI]

Alik: //And you should send them some kind of photos… [UI]

Natasha: Well…

Nastya: Selfie, send a selfie.

13:02

Zhenya: So, you know – five minutes are left.

Dasha: Thank God. //Zhenya, don’t block us //[UI]

Zhenya: //I am the most important really… //If only they let us eat…

Alik: That’s the key intonation…

Zhenya: //I think they will write in a minute or two…

Dasha: //I want to go to the bathroom.

Alik: //[UI]

Natasha: I managed the next assignment.




Nastya to Dasha: So there, here only yours works.

Alik: Here the main thing isn’t to win, it’s to play.

13:30

Natasha: No, well, here when you start to minimize, it is very interesting.

Ryan: //[UI]

Alik: Yeah.

Ryan: Yeah.

Alik: //Did you do your part?

Ryan: //Yeah.

Natasha: [UI] they gave us some kind of data.

Dasha: //In our shared chat. Group chat. //Why isn’t mine working?...

Natasha: //[UI]

Alik to Nastya: //She thinks that [UI]

Dasha: They praise us and yell at you, right?

Nastya: No, we aren’t talking with ours at all. //Ours already scored…

Alik: //No, ours told me: “I see these, I’ll write something else.”

13:59

Alik: //[UI]

Natasha: //No, wait. She isn’t writing anything.

Zhenya: /Yeah, they’re probably all dazed too…

Natasha: //Biomechanic, she didn’t even do anything.

Alik: //They were probably better prepared than us.




Dasha: Madam. Why is she giving me twenty-five thousand to enter? Are you sure? [UI]

Zhenya: Oh, the camera works…

Natasha: Ah, “A” …//And then what?

Alik to Nastya: //She is writing to you, speaking. I gave her the numbers. Now she is asking you for number too. Send them to her.

Natasha to Dasha: Wait, she wrote “A” [SL] “none” and [SL] “none.” What filters did you use?

Alik: For… //[UI]

Dasha: “A”…

Natasha to Dasha: Just “A”? And the rest? //You didn’t enter anything?

Nastya to Alik: //There, I just go it…

Natasha: It’s working there [UI]

00:01

Natasha: //[UI] … that’s basically it.

Alik:  [UI] For what reason?

Dasha: What do you mean that’s it? Time. There is still more time.

Natasha: //That’s it, you press OK and then you can work.

Zhenya: What, press OK?

Natasha: I mean, on the second and third filter in general we don’t enter any… aahhh, right here there is a zero.

Zhenya: //So, what was written there?

00:28

Dasha: [UI] Well, they praised me for [UI]… but for forty-seven? You have forty-two [UI], well… fine, a bit more.

Natasha: This is not important to me. This is not important to them. Okay.
 
Dasha: What is not important for them?

Natasha: They don’t care from which… what I used to make [UI]… //

Alik: Choose for yourself some kind of… //

00:59

Ryan:  [UI]…

Zhenya: [UI]…

Natasha: //[UI]…

01:29

Alik: Ryan, this is impossible to complete. Everybody changes the name… [UI]

Ryan: Do you remember what they told you originally?

Alik: This is ridiculous.

Ryan: It’s a…

Natasha: Don’t you remember they’re recording us? // Ah, there, I answered. // Well, dang it, this one… [UI]… of course. // Count more.

01:59

Dasha: //Listen, tell us, please, what do we need to do?

Natasha: //It looks like we’ll have to count everything here…

Ryan: //[UI]…

Dasha: //…Work miracles, work miracles…

Alik: //Ah, apologies… what we need to do.

Dasha: What do we need to do?

Alik: I already did everything… //No, Valera is yelling at Nastya now.
 
Nastya: //[UI]

Natasha: We have a married couple now.

Nastya: //Valera [UI]…

Alik: I can tell she’s in a good mood. //I know her…

Dasha: //I don’t understand…

02:29

Nastya: //You know her?

Alik: //[UI]…

Dasha to Alik: Right here, do these tabs need anything… ?

Alik: //Ah, here,  yes, we actually need to… Oh, you need to put checkmarks now. That means you need to do it fast now. If you decided, then put a checkmark.

Dasha: Decided what? I don’t know. I don’t know if I decided or not.

Alik: Do you have any digits?

Dasha: I do.

Alik: Well then put checkmarks.

Dasha: Where?

Alik: There in “Sign off.”

Dasha: I understand, but do the digits go anywhere or only right here… ?

Alik: … There you see, I’m putting one right now… //that’s it, I’m finished.

Zhenya: //[UI]…

Ryan: //[UI]…

03:01

Dasha: //… did you enter them anywhere?...



Alik: //Yes, I entered them…

Dasha: And saved it here…

Alik: Yes… on [SL] twenty and forty-nine…

Natasha: //how do you write “vyshe?”

Alik: //Higher

Natasha: //And how do you write that?

Alik: //[spelling] H-I-G-H-E-R…// H-I-G-H-E-R.

Natasha: Yeah, I got it…

Zhenya: Yes! Yes!

Ryan: Signed off!

Zhenya: Yes!

Alik: Zhenya, are you done?

Zhenya: That’s how it’s done!

03:28

Ryan: //Drilling…Drilling specialist [UI]

Alik: Oh, somehow removed their checkmark.

Nastya: Drilling specialist? And she didn’t wait for my answer…

Dasha: Done! Now we can’t change anything… right?

Nastya: //She was waiting for my reply…

Alik: //And you didn’t write to her?

Dasha: //[UI]…need to exit…

Natasha: Is there any way to save this all somehow? //How do you save?




Ryan: //[UI]

Natasha: How do you save?

Ryan: //[UI]

Natasha: I named it names

Ryan: Sign off page //[UI]

Alik: This checkmark, I think…

Natasha: //Plus? Checkmark…

Alik: //Checkmark. Then it saves… [SL] Update saved.

03:55

Ryan to Nastya: //Are you on that page?

Nastya: //Yeah.

Dasha: //[UI]…

Ryan: And you see you are not signed off yet operational [UI]. So, if you agree //[UI]…// to twenty-three forty-nine down there//[UI]…

Natasha: //But why doesn’t it //[UI]

Ryan: //[UI]…

Alik: Ah, that’s Nastya…

Ryan: //[UI]…

Nastya: //but there is nowhere// [UI]…

Ryan: //Yeah, you can put that in there // if you’d like…

Alik: //[UI]…

Natasha: Well, you have to put an ex and then it will work //]UI]…

Dasha: //I did everything, that’s it…



04:26

Alik: //Zhenya, how much time is left?

Zhenya: //For some reason they aren’t messaging me. They only asked me this//…[SL] to write “pink.”

Alik: //They won’t write about the system anyway…

Zhenya: …yes.

Nastya: No, I won’t do that, or everything will disappear //[UI]…
 
Natasha: We got thirty-eight for output and nineteen for total output. That’s very little, right?

Dasha: //Where?

Nastya: Okay, I will…

Dasha: //But where are you looking?

Natasha: //[UI]…

Ryan: //Don’t feel pressure. There is no…

Natasha: //That’s not a lot, right?

Ryan: //It’s not like you have to win… //[UI]…

Natasha: //Is that not a lot? Total output nineteen//[UI] … //nineteen thousand.

04:56

Ryan: //Either way we’ll be finished.

Nastya: Really?

Natasha: //It said up to six hundred there…

Alik: //Yes, far from enough… //So the colony won’t survive.

Natasha: //It’s a very small colony…

Dasha to Ryan: //…seven nine seven nine…




Ryan: //… how many people have access to what you receive.

Zhenya: Oh, //[UI]…

Alik: Nastya, that’s you, right?

Ryan: Oh! She did it!

Dasha: //What did you do?

Ryan: // Now everyone has to read…

Zhenya: //Is that good or bad?

Alik: //She rearranged everything…

05:26

Dasha: //I want to go to the bathroom! //Please!

Alik: Go.

Dasha: //What will we do? What? What?

Alik: //Nastya ruined everything!

Dasha: //What should we do?

Ryan: [SL] …rejection.

Alik: //Are you going or not?

Zhenya: //[UI]

Nastya: Now, who was choosing the location? I mean, like, geologist, right?

Ryan: //[UI]…

Nastya: Why he is not looking to [UI] geology and structure? //And, you know…

05:55

Ryan: //You have to inform him. Is he in your team?




Nastya: No.

Ryan: Yeah, so all of us have to inform him.

Nastya: Well, maybe he thinks that we’ll invent …super …//[UI]… that will be stone layers. But then it will cost much more than… you know, other one. //So… it depends.

Ryan: //[UI]We are all signing off on that thing.

Alik: Well, it’s too late. //All the checkmarks are already...

Ryan: //[UI]

06:22

Nastya: You all hate me, right?

All: //[UI]

Alik: //And for what reason?

Nastya: Stone layers.

Alik: //What does “stone layers” mean?

Nastya: //Tiles.

Alik: //That’s a real reason…

Nastya: Of course… [to Ryan] He is like: “You have a real reason for playing around…”

Alik to Dasha: Quick, quick, quick…

Dasha: //I’m hurrying, I’m hurrying…

Alik: Place the checkmarks again…

Ryan: //[UI]

Dasha: //Where do we put checkmarks? What do we do? Speak. Command me!

Ryan: //We are waiting on operations. Operations specialist.





Dasha: //[UI]

Nastya: //Fine, I found your checkmark…

Alik: [UI]


07:00
 
Dasha: //Should I just click where all these checkmarks are or… [UI]

Alik: //Yes. Put your signature here and that’s all.

Dasha: //Okay…

Natasha: //[UI]

Zhenya: //Ah, that’s it! Now I get it. So, I need to put my signature.

Alik: Yes.

Natasha: But mine went away… //Ah, no…

Zhenya: And they are just rethinking it…

Alik: //Everyone, everyone needs to sign.

Ryan: //[UI]

Alik: //Nastya again… Ah, no [UI]

Natasha: //[UI] here-there…

Dasha: //I am clicking OK, yes, and it doesn’t [SL] it flies away…

Alik: …//You need to do it again…

Natasha: And she will appear? Now it’s there.

Alik: No, Nastya will not appear.

07:30





Natasha: [UI] there is engineer// Operation is also there.

Dasha: //Did you click it, Nastya?

Nastya: I clicked it…

Dasha: And?

Nastya: //I don’t know…

Alik: We can’t see…

Natasha: //[UI]

Nastya: //[UI]

Alik: Yeah!

Dasha: Thank God!! //My Lord!

Zhenya: That’s not all. //Now something will appear again. I don’t agree with this…

Ryan: //[UI]

All: //[UI]

08:02

Natasha: No, well we did it. Too little water, of course!

Alik: //So, good.

Ryan: //It’s not gonna happen if Igor is gonna call and say…

Alik: //Okay, next…

Dasha: //I propose a hug…

Alik: //No, we’re not done yet…

Natasha: Yes, let’s go, let’s go…

Dasha: //We did the first task…




Nastya: //Coffee! I want coffee!

Alik: //[UI]

Natasha: //Well, they don’t want to hug…

Alik: //Stay focused, stay focused…

Zhenya: //So, next, next…

Alik: //The next after this is [SL] D Church eight. We need it right now…

Zhenya: //Here, in this?

Alik: [SL] D Church eight. Yes

08:32

Zhenya: //[SL] D Church eight.

Alik: [SL] D Church eight.

Zhenya: [SL] D Church eight.

Alik: //here here…

Dasha: I didn’t like this D Church from the very beginning. [talking to the camera] In fact, Igor, please give the client my thanks. He’s just like [SL] Tishin, but a bit worse. //But that’s nothing…

Zhenya: //The eighth D Church, right?

Alik: The eighth, D Church eight, yes.

Zhenya: Project Red, that one?

Alik: //Mhm.

Dasha: //We all have the exact same thing there, right?

Zhenya: //Oh, Sirius crew.

Alik: Here is NASA’s number. I mean the five-digit.





09:05

Dasha: That is very important for me.

Zhenya: Ah, this one… NASA’s…

Alik: Mhm, mhm…

Zhenya: okay, forty-six…

Dasha: Are they identical? Do we have identical questionnaires? Oh, yes. Can you translate, please? [talking to the camera] I don’t have a dictionary right now…

09:30

Zhenya: What is your role?

Ryan: //[UI]

Dasha to Alik: //And what is it asking here? Yes yes yes yes yes….

Ryan: //[UI]

Alik: [translating the questions] How well do you know the following people? That is, drilling, operation…

Dasha: Drilling is who? Not you?

Alik: This is our Chicago //group.

Natasha: //Martian group…

Dasha: //Oh, really?

Natasha: It says there…

Dasha: Who is the materials specialist?

Alik: Me.

Dasha: The operator is Nastya?

Nastya: No.




Dasha: //Then who is it?

Natasha: //Why? Nastya is the operator.

Alik: //Operations specialist, yes.

Nastya: //I’m not the operator… I am Operations specialist, okay…

10:01

Alik: And who is biomechanical?

Dasha: Biomechanical //is our [UI], Mechanical…

Natasha: … that’s not ours, on the contrary…

Zhenya: //And moderate means fine?

Alik: //Huh?

Zhenya to Alik: //Moderate: does that mean fine?

Dasha to Natasha: //Hydrogeologist…

Natasha to Dasha: //Hydrogeologist is theirs…

Alik to Zhenya: //It means you know them but we’re not close.

Dasha to Natasha: //Sedimentologist…

Natasha to Dasha: //Theirs.

Alik to Zhenya: // We know each other but we’re not close.

Dasha: Ah, got it, I see… Martian Terra Specialist – who is that?

Natasha: That is Zhenya.

Dasha –That was totally awesome…

Natasha: And here it means how well do you know him.






Dasha: Yes, I understand.

10:31

Nastya: //[UI]

Zhenya: Moderate is just fine?

Nastya: //Yes.

Zhenya: //I haven’t figured them out yet…

Alik: Yes.

Nastya to Zhenya: You don’t know each other well? //Zhenya…

Zhenya: //I don’t remember who or what…

Natasha: //[UI] and meteorologist…

Zhenya: I only remember Ryan… Meteorologist…//[UI]

Dasha: It says there: “space or no space.”

Zhenya: But space – is that us or something?

Dasha: Yes.

Zhenya: Ah, that’s it then. I get it then… so, space…

11:03

Dasha: And who complimented us? Do you remember, materialist?

Natasha: Biomechanical engineer wrote [UI], and materialist is the one who complimented you. // This is Maintenance specialist; this one is Maintenance… 

Dasha: [UI]… even the operator [UI]

Natasha: [UI]

Dasha: …[UI] changed something there…





Zhenya: And if you just scroll through? Okay? Does it work?

11:32

Alik: Probably… Well this D Church will answer for it…

Zhenya: Oh, it works… That’s it, I’m done.

Dasha: //[UI]

Alik: …So…so.

Dasha: [UI]

Natasha: Oh, we need to choose someone here… [SL]Tough choice…

Nastya: They’ll choose me now…

12:02

Alik: Yes, exactly, Nastya…

Zhenya: I scrolled through.

Natasha: Yes, you can scroll through. True.

Dasha: Oh, what’s so hard about that? Had you not made it there yet?

Alik: //There.

Dasha: I did all that already…

Alik: [UI]

Dasha: [UI]

Zhenya: And some of us had fun…

Natasha: And I basically everyone… [UI]

Dasha: [reading the questions] Describe your disciplinary team.

Nastya to Alik: What are you writing? Did you fall in love with Valera?




Natasha: Valera…

Alik to Nastya: This is my personal business… I’m not going to share it with you.

12:36

Nastya: But we need to choose… can we pick from our own team?

Alik: You can.

Alik to Dasha: Are you talking about this?

Dasha: Yes yes… What do we need to do here? Describe your…  

Alik: Describe your team. Meaning, what kind of team you were on. Geologists, maybe, robots…

Natasha: //[UI]

Dasha: And then, the first one?

Alik: [translating the questions] The first one is my team… worked together… //people put all their efforts into what we did… the second, so did they invest everything [UI]

13:06

Zhenya: //This questionnaire?

Dasha: //Yes yes…

Natasha: Disciplinary team- that’s just the team, right?

Alik: Yes, that’s the team… //Third… //That’s it.

Dasha: //They couldn’t just have written this properly instead of having to move the letters?

Alik: Yes. [translating the questions] They were all engaged in completing the task.

Dasha: //Yes, Zhenya totally was: he engaged with his head…

Zhenya: //Yeah, I worked so hard.

Alik to Zhenya: Here relax a bit.

Natasha: And this means our team – only Dasha and I// or Sirius?



Alik to Natasha: Your Chicago… //no no, only this one… Disciplinary team…

Natasha: //So me, Dasha aaand…

Dasha: //Ah, the exercise doesn’t say… [UI]

13:39

Alik: So, where were we, the fourth one? [translating the questions] Everyone gets along well with one another.

Nastya to Alik: You and I have disagree…

Alik: Fifth- everyone likes working together.

Zhenya: Of course.

Alik: //Six…

Natasha: //After this it’s going to be about Sirius.

Alik: Everyone has good relations on this team.

Zhenya: Absolutely. I got to keep time.

Alik: You’re the favorite there.

Zhenya: Yeah.

Alik: And now about Sirius. So, all the same questions… If you want, I can repeat them. But // now they are asking about us…

14:09

Natasha: //So not about the team no, but about all [SL] Siriuses, right.

Alik: //About us. //[UI]…

Zhenya: //[UI] everyone was fine…

Alik: Huh?






Zhenya: I think all the questions are “agree”

Dasha: //Yes yes yes

Alik: Then say “agree.”

Zhenya: //So… more…

Dasha: //Holy mother. Rate your level //[UI]…

Natasha: Oh, how do I write that?// About Martians? We’ve barely communicated with them…

Dasha to Natasha: Meaning? They praised you and //shouted at Nastya.

Alik: //[UI]...I made that up…

Dasha: Free translation.

14:38

Alik: But then Nastya ruined everything for everyone out of spite. //And everything started over…

Nastya: //[UI]

Zhenya: //Do the Martians have good ones? Any bad questions?

Dasha: No, they have…

Zhenya: Are they good?

Dasha: Yes.

Alik: So, it’s all the same questions.

Dasha: Yes, //only first we do our own, then Sirius, then the Martians, and then all together.

Alik: //Yes, first the small team, then Martians… and then more all together? 

Dasha: Yes.

Alik: But I’m still not there…








Dasha: //And I already answered.

Zhenya: I even wrote to Uncle Kruzik here.

15:13

Alik: They are writing about us[UI] right now.

Dasha: They are too? //They are over there…

Alik: I just think they are also… Ryan, are they doing the survey on their side too?

Ryan: Yes.

Dasha: //Yes?

Alik: //See, they are doing it too… Yes

Dasha: They aren’t as good…//[UI]

Natasha: //Let them send it.

Dasha to Alik: Rate your level… Are you that far?

Alik: //Almost, just a second…

Nastya: //Ah, I didn’t put everything…

Zhenya: And this one “Disciplinary team” – what is that?

Alik: It’s your small team. Geologists… //Mechanics///

Zhenya: Ah, well that’s “agree,” fine…

Alik: Yes.

Zhenya: So… Sirius team too…

Dasha: //[UI]…

15:47

Nastya to Alik: So, we did it for the small team…





Alik to Nastya: So, there are other questions here. New questions now, first page. [translating the questions] So, we understand each other’s talents well…

Dasha: Where? Wait wait…

Ryan: //[UI]

Nastya: //[UI]

Alik to Nastya: No, I know for sure.

Nastya: I clicked on “neither agree nor disagree.”

Alik: The neutral one here is best… there, next…

Zhenya: This one “neither,” right?

16:09

Alik: [translating the questions] The members of my small team possess knowledge that befits their abilities and skills... Then… and each of them knows who has which strengths on the team… Ah, and everyone knows who has special abilities related to their work… And then the same questions about us…

16:46

Natasha: About Mars… about Project Red.

Alik: Yes.

Dasha: What is “incompatibility?”

Alik: “Incompatibility” – that means compatibility…

Dasha: … “incompatibility,” “incompatibility” means what?

Alik: “incompatibility” – //that means they can work together well.

Ryan: //[UI]

Natasha: //This camera is moving…






17:16

All: //[UI]

Nastya: //[UI] look they meant it for you.

Natasha: For whom?

Nastya: They meant it for you…

Natasha: For Ryan?

Alik: Ryan, they are filming your glasses… “Incompatibility”…

Dasha: What is “incompatibility?”

Alik: The ability to work together.

Dasha: Oh, that’s great! Every time.

Natasha: //All day, all night… [UI]

17:48

Dasha: //[UI] you what for her? Well, we’re generally all good…//[UI]

Zhenya: Usually, I think is fine… sometimes, there I did sometimes and usually.

Alik: Are you already looking at [UI]?

Zhenya: I already passed that…

Alik: Wow, really?

Zhenya to Ryan: “Sometimes” means “sometimes”?

Ryan: Mhm.

Dasha: [UI]

18:21

Dasha: And how does “incompatibility” translate?




Alik: “Incompatibility” is the ability to work together.

Dasha: “Incompatibility”

Alik: Not just work – live together…

Zhenya: //“Incompatibility” … pronunciation…

Dasha: “Incompatibility”

Nastya: But it’s INcompatibility.

Alik: No – “incompatible.” I mean “compatible” means “together.”

Nastya: Compatibility, well…


Alik: “Incompatibility”: is INcompatibility, yes// the opposite…

Dasha: Totally! Not only did you give me the wrong translation, we’re also not getting along!...

18:53

Natasha: “Incompatibility” is about what?

Ryan: Incompatibility is not being able //to…

Nastya: //Not!

Ryan: …//so if I’m not able to work with you, you and I are incompatible.

Nastya: //What he told her is opposite. Like, compatible to work with each other…

Ryan: Well, he probably said…

Dasha: I said that one word like fifty times!...

Alik: Well, I was just enjoying hearing the word.

Dasha: I just said that you’re bad.

19:23





Dasha: I regret it. I don’t like writing bad things about you… for now… You just had to mess that up, huh?... So, let’s start over… [talking to the camera] Igor, we’re starting over.

Dasha to Alik: You got too far ahead.

Natasha: //[UI]… I don’t know, maybe…

19:52

Dasha to Ryan: Now you… What is this?

Zhenya: [UI}

Ryan to Dasha: [translating the question] I’m not going to wait again… work.

Dasha: Thank you very much. There see, that’s some good translation.

Ryan: //That’s the best I could do…

Alik: //I won’t complete [UI]… I’m done with that job./ I’m fired… I was fired!

20:23

Ryan: //We are just gonna put Igor on the phone. Forty-four seven…

Alik: But dad is leaving soon.

Dasha: Daddy isn’t leaving soon. Only in a month… [talking to the camera] Are you aware that you are their daddy? At least for one of them.

Alik: He’s an uncle to me.

Dasha: [talking to the camera] And an uncle to some…

Natasha: After all, he works with these guys who… what are they… from the Martian group.
Rumors abound.

20:56

Dasha: That he’s someone’s daddy?

Natasha: Yes.





Dasha: [talking to the camera] Ah there, now guess whose it is.

Natasha: They’re going to call Canada now… //They didn’t get it…

Dasha: Well, I don’t think their word for “daddy” translates quite the same.

Nastya: And what, he’s from Canada?

Natasha: Well, the one listening is from Canada [UI]…

Dasha: [UI]…

Natasha: [UI]…

21:26

Dasha: And we just leave this one? Don’t click anything, right?

Ryan: //No.

Dasha: //So leave all this?

Alik: //Yes.

Ryan: No, not all of it…//[UI]

Dasha to Alik: This is the second time you lied to me!

Alik: //I’m finished…

Natasha: Dasha, please be more careful! I’m asking you!

Nastya: That’s my greenhouse!

Alik: Yes, there are peas growing there… please be careful.

Nastya: //It’s a greenhouse.

Ryan: //I know, how big are they now?

Nastya: You can, you can have a look.

21:56


Alik: Then…

Ryan: After this.

Natasha to Nastya: Will they fruit?

Nastya: Yes.

Natasha: Wow!

Ryan: Is it edible?

Nastya: Yeah, beans.

Natasha: //You didn’t say for some reason…

Nastya: //Well…

Alik: //Zhenya, did you finish?

Zhenya: //Not yet.

Alik to Zhenya: //And which one are you on now?...

Zhenya to Alik: Well there…

Alik to Dasha: //Do you need anything translated?

Dasha: //No.

Alik: Well, if it’s neutral there… So, you don’t agree and don’t //[UI]…

Nastya: //[UI]…

22:26

Ryan: //[UI]…

Natasha: //[UI]…

Dasha: Zhenya, did you already do this?

Zhenya to Dasha: No, that’s where I am.




Dasha to Zhenya: Just “next?”

Zhenya to Dasha: Just “next?”

Dasha: Yes.

Zhenya to Dasha: Are you here already?

Dasha: I’m a bit further. On the next page. Ryan and I are neck and neck here… Ryan, you already ran ahead… I can’t keep up with you…

23:01

Natasha: [UI]…

Dasha: [UI]…

Zhenya: So, “Moderate flight related?” What is that?

Alik: “Is it related to flight?”

Dasha: For whom? Who needs this?

Zhenya:  Yes.

Alik to Zhenya: Ah, are you saying average?

Zhenya: Yes.

Natasha: So…//[UI]…

Alik to Zhenya: Ah, well, if “not related,” it’s not related. //This same question…

Dasha: //Oh dear…

23:30

Zhenya: //[UI]…and experimenting and calculation… basically…

Alik: Ah, so we need to fill out this matrix, right?

Zhenya: Probably…





Dasha: What matrix?

Zhenya: This one… Like this…

Nastya: The operators are there, count them…

Alik: //Ah, yes…

Nastya: //He didn’t understand…

Zhenya to Alik: //And what is this question? I mean, which answer?

Alik to Zhenya: Let me count right now…//I’m just not there right now…

24:01

Nastya to Zhenya: //You trust him?

Zhenya: Yes, I’m a simple guy. I trust everyone.

Natasha: [UI]

Alik: Ah, so [translating the questions] How related are the construction of the new well and the different calculations. I mean, how connected are they with each other.

Zhenya: //Well, come on…

Dasha: //What if I just guessed, no big deal?

Alik: Then you can pick the average one, that…

Zhenya: “moderate,” right?

Alik: “moderate,” yes.

Zhenya: Well, that’s what I thought…

24:29

Natasha: Yes, this is pretty tough… we don’t understand the point too well, but anyway… [UI]

Alik: [UI]

25:02



Dasha: “incompatibility,” right?

Alik: “incompatibility,” // in-com-pa-ti-bi-li-ty

Zhenya: //Oh, [UI]

Dasha and Alik: in-com-pa-ti-bi-li-ty

Dasha: “incompatibility”

Zhenya to Ryan: //That’s it?

Ryan: Yes, excellent.

Alik: And if you removed “in” then it’s “compatibility.” //You get it, right?

Zhenya: //That’s it, we’re closing it?

Alik: Huh?

Zhenya: We’re closing it, right?

Alik: Did you finish?

Zhenya: //Yes.

Dasha: //We’ll just quickly…

Alik: //Moderate, right?

Natasha: //[UI]

Dasha to Alik: There you missed it.

25:32

Alik: No…

Dasha: But why is everything yellow?

Natasha: //[UI]

Dasha: “incompatibility” is interaction with each other, right?




Alik: So, it’s the opposite… “compatibility” yes, they work and live well together…

Dasha: ‘incompatibility”

Alik: //… they are different, “incompatibility.”

Dasha: //you and I are “incompatibility.”

Alik: Right now, yes. I agree…

Dasha: But yesterday evening here there was “compatibility.”

Alik: “compatibility” happens… Oh, careful, don’t break a pea…

Nastya: //It always happens…

Alik: Careful… 

26:02

Zhenya: Come on, more peas fell… //[UI]

Alik: //[UI]

Dasha: Ah, they’re writing to us…

Zhenya: //Does it actually grow there? The little pea?

Dasha: //Yes.

Alik: After D Church II[UI]… open Video three… Together. You don’t need the headphones right now. Ryan will turn on the sound. Go to Video three.

Nastya: //Just a second, wait…

Zhenya: So, but how…

Alik: Just wait for us. Nastya and I haven’t finished yet.

Zhenya: Well of course… //and we just minimize this, right?

Natasha: //Oh, it’s so small!





Alik: Yes, you better not close it yet. Just minimize it. I don’t know if we’ll still need it.

Dasha: //It’s just a little bush…

Natasha: //Yes…

26:33

Ryan: //[UI]

Alik: Huh?

Ryan: //Project [SL] Red Breely

Alik: //Project [SL] Red Breely

Natasha: //Project Red we don’t close… just minimize.

Alik: //Minimize it, yes.

Zhenya: //And what is this? Just training?

Ryan: //[UI]

Alik: //Project [SL] Red Breely is //[UI] training //[UI]

Ryan: //[UI]

Zhenya: Ah, training…

Dasha: And what are we waiting?

Alik: The third video. Just the same as last time. We turn off the sound, and Ryan //turns on the sound.

Natasha: //Ah, the third video? Could I please have one apricot?

Zhenya: Certainly.

27:02








Dasha: I tell you right away. Did you see the first word? This is a tough task.

Natasha: Thank you.

Zhenya: //Come on.

Ryan: You’re welcome.

Dasha: //Project Red… 

Natasha: //There, now it’s like a voice recorder…

Alik: Just a sec, wait… Ready? Everyone ready?// Three, two, one. Let’s go!

Video: The project [SL] Red Breely //[UI]

All: //[UI]

27:31

Nastya  to Ryan: Mine is louder.

Natasha to Nastya: What did you say to him?

Nastya to Natasha: Mine is louder

Video: Due to channel restriction issues [UI] will have direct contact with two of the individuals in your task force. Twelve individuals include [UI] and six mission support members. In the Project Red [SL] Breely we will choose two people who will be most effective in helping you relate any [UI] or anyone else in the larger group //[UI]

28:07

Dasha: //So, we’re working with the same scheme, right? We choose to our left… // and any, rather registered, Chicagoan… And they choose how they want and all work together…

Ryan: So each of us will choose the one to the left, right?

Alik: Yes… So, you choose me, I choose Nastya, Nastya chooses the fourth// and so on…

Ryan: //[UI]

Dasha: Look…// I am first…

Nastya: //He is telling us… //[UI]


Dasha: And Alik //[UI]

28:37

Video: //Project Red roles.

Dasha: //[UI]

Ryan: I choose, you choose… and you choose one person from Chicago. //That way if we receive a message, we just rotate and if it was Chicago… //[UI

Dasha: I choose hydrogeologist.

Ryan: And him? //[UI]

Alik: //[UI] Nastya…

Dasha: And Nastya…

Ryan: Sedimentologist, remember that. Maintenance.

Natasha: Maintenance

Ryan: Drilling specialist

Zhenya: //Drilling.

Alik to Zhenya: So you are Drilling and his. //You have two people: Ryan and Drilling.

Natasha: Maintenance and Zhenya.

Nastya to Natasha: //I have mechanical engineer, right?

Ryan: //And I’m Biochemist and…

Dasha: //No, she is not mechanical.

Natasha: No, mechanical.
//Nastya: [UI] [laughter]

//Ryan: Structural geologist, an operation, … [UI]

//Alik: No, that’s right, that’s right. The plan is solid.

//Nastya: Yes.

Natasha: [UI]

Ryan- [UI]

Dasha: What if he’s an engineer?

//Nastya- Of course, they sit in soft chairs!

//Ryan: Alright.

Dasha to Alik:  And who are you?

//Alik: I am materials

//Ryan- [UI] [laughter]

//Alik to Ryan: [UI] we can help [UI]

00:32

Alik: I don’t think anyone can hear who is saying what, right?

Nastya: Yes.

Natasha: Do we have to remember who is who?

Ryan- We know.

Natasha: Materials, operator, mechanical engineer, meteorologist, [UI]

Dasha to Ryan: [SL] Remove this please [UI], please have a look.

Zhenya: Drilling.

Alik: Drilling.

Natasha: Drilling and meteorologist.

Ryan: Ready to get started?

Dasha: Wait. Look, we’re removing …

//Alik: We know what to do. If the video is eight minutes, you can turn it off.

01:01

Dasha: …Besides that, from the person on your left… If you open the table, actually PowerPoint, where everything is written down. Starting with me, we go… I choose hydrogeologist. This is Alik: [SL] senior hydrogeologist. Then Nastya…

Alik: Right, right. Yes.

//Nastya: Sedimentologist.

//Ryan to Zhenya: So you are gonna go back.

//Alik: Okay, so now we go again – [SL] True data, project [UI]

//Nastya: Everything is fine, don’t worry.



01:30

Ryan: [PH] Project Gray Breely.

Alik: [PH] Project Gray Breely.

Natasha: So, now what? Project track now?

Alik: Project track, project data.

Natasha: And… [PH] Project Gray Breely.

Ryan:  [UI]…

Natasha:  Ah… yours first, right? [UI]

//Alik: Yes, choose.

Natasha: You first …

//Ryan: It’s working.

Alik: There we go, good. That’s it!

02:01

Alik: And now choose two people you already know.

Natasha: Yes. Yes.

//Zhenya: So, drilling …

Natasha: [UI]

Zhenya: Yes, meteorologist and … So, I am drilling, drilling …

Ryan: [UI]

02:29

Zhenya: Eighty, Ninety-one …

Alik: Wow!
 
Natasha: Here we go!

//Alik: Here we go!

//Ryan: [SL] Show!

Natasha: [UI] so, I will send it to you. You send it to Ryan. Ryan –to [SL] Lilya. [SL] Lilya to materials. 

Zhenya: You are drilling, right?

Natasha: You send it to Ryan.

Zhenya:  I already sent it.

Natasha: That’s it.

03:10

Dasha: [UI] it worked here! [UI]

Natasha: [laughter] That instead of us.

Nastya: [UI]

Zhenya: [SL] You maneuvered it? I don’t have… It’s fine, just ten minutes here… [SL] They really didn’t say.

Natasha: [laughter]

Zhenya: [laughter]

03:56

Natasha: Well!! … Not a single letter! [laughter]

Dasha: I’ve already done ten or more!

Natasha: Yeah, totally… [UI]

Zhenya:  I still don’t understand, but I get the team… We’re forwarding everything.

Alik: We’re forwarding. Yes.

 
04:33

Alik: Eight minutes left.

Natasha: Materials. Materials again.

Natasha: So, when it’s materials I am biomechanics again. Do you all have biomechanics?

Zhenya: Yes.

Dasha: Mhm.

//Ryan: [UI]

Natasha: So, I’ll send everything to you, then. Now. And now this one … and this … Mechanical, and this one also goes to you.

05:08

Natasha:  These are our guys.

Dasha: Hmm, okay, okay, so.

Natasha: Oh, beautiful!

05:38

Alik: Nastya, do you have mechanical engineering?

Nastya: Me? Yes. Yes.

Alik: Yes?

Natasha: But who had biomechanical engineering?

Ryan: I did.

Natasha:  Ryan did?

Ryan:  I did.

Natasha:  You have biomechanical engineering?

Ryan: Yes.
Natasha: Then, Zhenya, I will send it to you, and you send it to Ryan.

Nastya: And this drilling, it looks like Zhenya has it.

Ryan: Zhenya has it.

Natasha: Zhenya has it. You can send to me, and you can send to me…

Nastya: [SL] Well, we’re not talking.

Natasha: Yes? Ah, okay.

06:08

Natasha: [laughter] Seriously, yes, when … [laughter]

Dasha:  Here, take it! Take it, catch!

Natasha: [laughter]

Zhenya: As they said: gentlemen don’t lie, and here I got lucky.

Natasha: There go materials. Try sending it around the circle. Yeees, Alik. For Alik around the circle.

Ryan to Alik: [SL] Structural. Oh, you got structural geology?

Alik: Hm? Yes, I do.

Natasha: [SL] Information, mechanical, [UI]. So, let’s send one more around the circle. And now for Ryan.

Zhenya: [singing] We’re spinning in circles, na na na.

Natasha: [UI]

Dasha: Mechanical, mechanical. Oh, there is something here.

00:33

Natasha: …if it makes it.

Alik: I’ll give it to you straight away.

Natasha: Oh, one more…

Dasha: [SL] Louder.

Natasha: What time are we finished?

Alik: Four minutes and change.

//Natasha: No. That’s it. Not just this one.

//Alik: And there will be one more [SL] apostrophe.



01:03

//Nastya: At five.

//Natasha: Still in this program.

Alik: [PH] D Church nine. Then… I’ll tell you. Then there will be … 
The evening Volcano, right? Then we come back here. One more exercise. Then we’re done. Like that.

Dasha: I think we can send stuff like this around the circle to each other… We also have a second dude… And us…

//Natasha: Mhm, we have several more dudes over there, I think, that nobody picked. A few more…

//Dasha: Are they ours?

01:31

Natasha: No, there are a few more… There are a few more of them than us.

Dasha: But each of us already has everything?

Natasha: Not everything. I think there are two or three people there…

//Alik: There are more there… [UI] people there.

Natasha: Last time we had several people extra.

Dasha: Now everything is zeroes so we can send stuff around the circle… //And sooner or later…

//Natasha: Okay, then take it. [laughter]

Dasha: A little response? [laughter]

Natasha: [UI[ sent.

02:00

Natasha: I have a letter for Nastya.

Dasha: Lets go in a circle.

Natasha: Yes, yes. I am always sending to Zhenya and sending it on.




//Dasha: And Zhenya sends it on?

//Natasha: And a letter for Ryan…

Zhenya: Yes.

Natasha: Maintenance good job, that’s to me.

Ryan: [UI]

Natasha: And one more letter for Zhenya.

02:32

Dasha to Alik: I am correct that you have drilling, right?

//Alik: No, Zhenya has drilling.

//Dasha: Zhenya has drilling. Yes.

Dasha: Ah, really?

Natasha: But it reaches me too, drilling is also [UI] [laughter]

Dasha: Well it also often reaches me. We can just send it around the circle.

Natasha: Zhenya isn’t very happy when he gets drilling.

//Zhenya: Yeah, it’s fine. [UI]

//Alik: [UI]

//Natasha: [laughter] Right to the end, yes.

Zhenya: There is also the word drill.

//Natasha: Cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

//Zhenya: A Russian word.

03:00

Alik: Oh! Drilling [laughter] For you, countryman!

Alik: Two and a half minutes left.


Zhenya: Drilling again. Good boy!

Ryan: It’s the most popular.

Zhenya: Yes.

Nastya: Do we have time to make coffee?

Natasha: And get a pillow.

Alik: Well, let’s also do [PH] D Church right now. No, no. Before the Volcano. No. Because everything has to be on time there.

Nastya: Fine.

03:28

Alik: That’s not Igor’s fault, that’s FPI.

Nastya: Why bring up Igor right away? It’s not your fault, right?

Alik: Me of course.

Nastya: I sent it… Done.

Dasha: Will you catch it or not? //We are waiting for when they…

//Natasha: No, they go slow.

Zhenya: They went to make coffee.

Dasha: Exactly.

Natasha: Material is this … Material was this… who had it? Ah, [SL] it’s ours. Our dude. Our dude. And this is for Ryan.

04:09

Alik: More than half are just drilling, drilling, drilling.

Nastya: Yes. Here, here. Everything to me.

Natasha: Mhm… Yes, send all the drills here. And maintenance too.

Dasha: There is a lot of this drilling. One after the next.


//Zhenya: Come on, send them!

//Alik: [SL] It’s coming right now.

04:29

Dasha: We don’t need these Chicagoans anyway. // We can do it all.

//Natasha:  [laughter] In a circle! [laughter].

//Zhenya: Come on! Come on, here!

Natasha: There, Zhenya, open the gates.

//Zhenya: Come on!

Dasha: You see, at first, we sent it to everyone, but the second time we do it we will send it to ourselves. And it will just come to them, and they will be sitting there for ten minutes like: “Ummm.”

Alik: Less than a minute.

Dasha: They say they come up with a million-dollar tactic now. Get ready.

05:10

Alik: Thirty seconds left.

Dasha: And then again for ten minutes.

Natasha: [SL] Like planks. Twenty-five.

Nastya: Twenty-five [laughter] twenty-five.

//Zhenya: You still have to stand up after.

Nastya: Come on, come on. Right. Chase. Especially me.

Nastya: Chicagoans, Chicagoans! Or I’ll burst out of here like the Hulk.

Zhenya: Don’t do it. It won’t work.

Natasha: I wouldn’t want to. [laughter]

05:40



Zhenya: Three, two, one!

Dasha: Heeey!

Zhenya: We beat everyone.

Alik: Yes!

Natasha: Aren’t they supposed to tell us or what?

Dasha: No, this is [UI]

//Natasha: Wait, can I?

//Alik: Well, fine, fine.

//Nastya: Some want coffee, some want a bathroom.

//Zhenya: So, I’m drilling again.

//Nastya: So, who wants coffee? Come on.

Dasha to Alik: You’re the material specialist, right?

//Ryan to Alik: You wanna do it again?

Alik: Yes.

Dasha to Alik: Ah, hydrogeologist and …Materials, materials, right?

Natasha: I am maintenance and terraforming.

Alik to Ryan: Ah, yes, yes. Yes. You are right. So, twenty minutes on this. Everything is right.

06:16

Alik: I am choosing…

Zhenya: Oh! look! You can “soskliznyosh!” [Made up word for “slip off”]

Nastya: “Soskliznyosh?” Is that a new word?

Zhenya: You haven’t heard that one before?

Nastya: No.


Zhenya: I know “Soskliznyosh.” In fact, that’s what they said where the wedding was.

Nastya: That makes sense.

Zhenya: There is also “Ponadbordeurom”

Dasha: “Ponadbordeurom?”

Nastya: I am economizing. I said I am economizing on coffee.

Dasha: No, don’t hold back!

Natasha: Three scoops at least.

//Dasha: I think more.

06:47

Nastya: How much are you making?

Natasha: I am putting two scoops in the mug. Like that.

Dasha: Enough, that’s enough.

Natasha: Oh! They’re big!

Nastya: Oh, dude. Whose is this?

Ryan: Uh-oh!

Natasha: Uh-oh! At least it’s not liquid.

Ryan: Yeah.

Nastya: Sorry.

Zhenya: It’s fine.

Natasha: [UI] camera…

Nastya: Why didn’t you eat your apricot?

Natasha: That one fell.

Nastya: What did it fall on? Not on the floor. We can wash it.


07:19

Dasha: Ryan, give me a knife please.

Ryan: Knife.

Dasha: Yes.

Ryan: For you.

Dasha: Yes.

Dasha to Alik: “Greb,” right? Is that correct?

Alik: Apple.

Dasha: [laughter]

Ryan: [UI]

Alik: I heard “grape.” [laughter]

Ryan: [laughter] [UI] Pull it together.

Dasha to Alik: How do you say “khvatat?”

Alik: “Grab.”

Dasha: “Grab.”

07:49

Natasha: “Grab” like “grabli.”

Dasha: And “greb” means “vinograd,” right?

Natasha: “Grape.”

Alik: “Grape.”

Dasha: “Grape.”

Ryan to Nastya: [UI]

Nastya: My nipple?


Alik: What?!!

Ryan: Your people!!

Nastya: [UI]

Alik: Everything is being recorded!

Nastya: [laughter] I said it again! What is this? Come on!

Ryan: [SL] Fix your people [laughter]

Alik: Why… Ah here, ninety-one.

08:19

Natasha: Nastya, probably. Nastya, did you already choose?

Nastya: Yes.

Natasha: And which Chicagoan do you have, Alik?

Alik: What?

Natasha: Which Chicagoan do you have?

Alik: Ah, we have Valeria.

Natasha: No, which Chicagoan do you have here?

Alik: Ah, drilling.

Natasha: No, he has drilling.

Alik: No, he is writing drilling. That’s what our Chicago drilling guys say.

Natasha: No. Whom are you writing to? To Nastya or whom?

Alik: I am writing to Nastya and…

Nastya: Valeria [laughter]

Ryan: Structural.




08:50

Alik: Structural geologist.

Natasha: Ah, structural…

Alik: Yes, yes. //So, that’s it, here we go.

Natasha: … so for [UI] I have … And Ryan for biomechanical. And for Ryan.

Nastya: What a nightmare! I said so much!

Natasha: [UI]

Alik: [UI]

09:18

Natasha: Of course, if we could guess which of us the Chicagoans have, we could do this much faster.

Alik: Well, of course.

Natasha: But that would require some complex calculations.

Nastya: [UI]

Natasha: [UI]

Zhenya: I told you what we need.

Dasha: What?

Nastya: [SL] Ah! A special code?

Zhenya: Yes. [SL] SNG [SNG is the Russian acronym for the Confederation of Independent States (CIS)].

09:47

Zhenya: Only eight minutes and forty-five seconds left.

Dasha: Why aren’t you doing anything for him?

Natasha:  What? It’s working.

Zhenya: I’m waiting, darn it.


Natasha –[UI]

Alik: [SL] Anyway.

Natasha: Oh, and for Ryan too.

Nastya to Alik: I think she makes him nervous.

Alik: Who?

Nastya: Natasha.

Alik: Natasha?

Nastya: Yes.

Alik: No way!

Natasha: [UI] [laughter]

Alik: Slackers will be slackers.

10:17

Zhenya: But I already recorded that… Without thinking. In the camera… Biomechanical.

Nastya: We are effective team.

//Natasha: Oh, one more…

//Zhenya: Come in…

Nastya: Like in the movie “Oblivion” are we an effective team? [sic]

Zhenya: Oblivion- [SL] are these paths?

Nastya: Yes, but did you see the film with Tom Cruise?

Zhenya: Mhm.

Nastya: In it they ask: “Are we an effective team?”

Zhenya: Ah, yes.




10:47

Natasha: Yes, yes, yes. Then it turns out that…

Zhenya: That they aren’t even a team…

Natasha: And aren’t even people, in fact… Ow Ow Ow Ow

Alik: Here we go, here we go, here we go…

Natasha: Sooo… And who had this sedimentologist?

Nastya: I did.

Alik: So…

Nastya: In a circle.

Alik: There it goes…

Natasha: Mechanical engi… That’s my specialist… well, fine … hold on then.

11:18

Zhenya: Mechanical.

//Dasha: There will also be a questionnaire after?

//Natasha: In a circle. We’re sending everything around the circle.

//Zhenya: Sedimentologist around the circle, right?

//Natasha: Yes, around the circle.

Alik: [singing] Addressed to a friend, the song goes around, because the Earth is round!

Zhenya: But they weren’t singing about a song, but the other…about the harmony… So this “rologist” urologist in a circle… [Reference unknown to translator]

Nastya: Urologist?

11:47

Zhenya: Well there is a urologist here. Sedimentologist…

Ryan: Urologist [laughter]

Alik: [laughter] I see…

Nastya: [UI] a joke [UI]

Natasha: [laughter]

Zhenya: [laughter]

Zhenya: Well, that’s enough jokes today [laughter]

Alik: Well, it says here: “Only the period when the [PH] Project Track methodology is being directly implemented will be used for further analysis.”

12:18

Alik: So maybe they won’t count everything we are saying.

Zhenya: Yeah, don’t worry at all. Think. Want me to swear right now?

Nastya: No, everything is fine. That’s not swearing to them. Right, Ryan?

Alik: [UI]. Your opinion? Is [UI] a swear word?

Ryan: No.

Alik: Ryan has moved on already.

Nastya: What?

Zhenya: What, did he swear or something?

Alik: No. This project… The most important thig for them is …

Ryan: There we were yelling and screaming.

12:47

Nastya: Really?

Ryan: Yes.

//Alik: Yes. They shouted.

//Nastya: They shouted at the last meeting. The bad meeting. They shouted at each other.

Zhenya: Really?

Nastya: Well, they shouted at the screen. Yes.

Zhenya: And spat on it. When they spit, that is really…

//Nastya to Ryan: They spit. Spit. [laughter]

Zhenya: They spit.

Natasha: [UI]… Oh! Even that…

Nastya: [UI]

Ryan: I didn’t, personally.

Nastya:  [UI]

Alik: So other people took it very seriously?

Ryan: Yeah.

13:22

Alik: Nastya, did you get it?

Nastya: I don’t see it yet.

Alik: Ah, that means I did it wrong [UI]

Nastya: [laughter]

Alik: No, I forgot the system. If it’s direct to you, then everything is correct.

Natasha: The Chicagoans are also sending it to each other [laughter]

Alik: They are too.

Natasha: Here – there, here – there.

Alik: All that’s left is… four minutes and forty. //forty seconds.

Natasha: After this assignment we go to the Volcano? //Or after this assignment we do something else?

13:53

Alik: No, now we do [PH] D Church nine, and then we can stretch and go to the Volcano.

//Nastya: Yes.

//Zhenya: And then…

//Dasha: And for each of us… but, every Sunday is like this?

//Alik to Ryan: Every Sunday?

//Ryan: No, we only [UI] like five times.

Natasha: Do you remember how that went: “Oh volcano, my little volcano?”

Alik to Dasha: Only five times total.

//Dasha to Alik: Why, there were eight…

//Ryan: Actually…

//Zhenya: Not every Sunday?

//Dasha: Eight spots.

//Nastya to Ryan: How often?

//Dasha: Twice a month…

Ryan: How often… one, two…

//Zhenya: Come on, calm me down.

//Natasha: How often? How often will we have…?

14:23

Alik: No, this is not every weekend.

Dasha: No, every other weekend, I’m saying. Twice a month.

//Ryan: Two, three four, five, six…

//Alik: We’ll find out right now. But it’s definitely not every weekend.

//Ryan: Yeah. Eight times.

//Dasha: Eight times.


//Natasha: Alik, how did the Volcano get involved in…

Alik: In this?

//Natasha: Yes.

Ryan: Eight. Eight times.

Alik to Natasha: Ask Ryan that. I don’t know.

Natasha to Ryan: Ryan, how did the Volcano get incorporated in your methodology?

Alik: [translating to Ryan]

Ryan: The point is to transition immediately.

Ryan: You don’t have to translate.

Zhenya: Deal.

Alik: The most important thing is to go straight to the Volcano after this assignment. They want to see our reaction to the Volcano.

14:53

Ryan: And then, and then understand how you handle the transition.

Natasha: Ah, cool!

Alik: Take you, for example. This all made you so angry that you’ll be worse there on the Volcano, right? They’ll compare that to the morning Volcano.

Nastya: On the little Volcano.

Natasha: I understand, but the Volcano is for emergencies.

Alik: I know, but they somehow connected it with [UI]

Nastya: [UI]

Ryan: They just needed any, any experiment. It doesn’t matter. But the point is…

Alik: Ah [sic], any experiment? Ah, no no. It could have been any experiment. As long as the Volcano was next. They were just interested in how you would do on the next experiment.



15:28

Nastya: But how do they find out the results?

Ryan: They’ll see in the questionnaire. They’ll ask questions about how…

Alik: Yes. There will a questionnaire that will decide everything.

Dasha: The questionnaire shall decide everything!

Alik: Absolutely. Just like soy sauce [laughter]

Natasha: Well, I get it, I get it. They don’t really care what methodology is used there. //Just… [laughter]

//Alik: Yes, yes, yes. So, they aren’t going after your methodology. Don’t worry. 

Nastya: So surprising [laughter]

Nastya to Zhenya: You have two shirts. Me too.

Zhenya: Nooo, it’s…

Nastya: Not that comfortable…

15:59

Nastya: An ad, an ad… We’ll do it now…

Zhenya: Two right away?

Nastya: Mhm.

Zhenya: Even on underwear.

Nastya: The underwear don’t have…

Zhenya: Mine do. I tore it from here and stuck it on… with tape…

Natasha: [UI]

Zhenya: Two minutes left. And Volcano.

16:28

Alik: First [PH] D Church.

Zhenya: Ah, we still have D “chort”… [the Russian word for “devil,” which sounds like “church”)

Alik: Yes… [PH] D Church, and then already…

Nastya: So, should we leave these… recorders //when we leave?

//Alik: No, after D “chort” we can turn them… After [PH] D Church we can turn them off. [laughter]

Natasha: And how do you say “chort” in English?

Alik: Devil.

Ryan: Ah, I get it.

Alik: Devil.

Natasha: We add a little letter, and then we add another little letter [singing] Tram tra tra. And I think one more. And we send this… And that’s how we do it.

17:08

Zhenya: And we have a minute, twenty seconds left.

Nastya: [SL] Natasha sends it [UI] Don’t give anymore.

Natasha: Did it work? Is it okay?

Dasha: Why is it telling me I don’t have any “Targets,” even though I sent it right to the Materials specialist several times.

Zhenya: It means you missed the mark. You’re just not hitting it. It happens. You didn’t aim well.

17:40

Natasha: No, “Targets” are when... let’s say Ryan clearly sends it to you.

Dasha: Doesn’t Ryan get it then, no?

Natasha: You do.

Dasha: Really?

Zhenya: Forty seconds.

//Natasha: Meteorologist is for Ryan. This letter is for Ryan.


//Dasha: What is this? Ryan didn’t send me a letter?

Alik to Ryan: Did you send her any letters?

Natasha: No, we need…

//Ryan: Often.

//Alik: He says he sent you a lot…

Natasha: No, no. He… not simple ones, but with your name. 

//Alik: What you…

//Natasha: [UI]

Dasha to Alik: Click on this… this…

18:10

Natasha to Ryan: You have emailed [UI]?

//Dasha: Mine is completely empty here.

//Ryan: Not from…

//Alik: That’s impossible.

Dasha: Here, here, look!

//Ryan: [UI]

Alik: She has nothing in the records.

Natasha: And there is the airplane. I think that’s when you send it right.

Dasha: No, it’s just a message.

Alik: [UI]

Dasha to Ryan: Do you have all these? Ah. And I have zero! Zero!

Zhenya: That’s it!

Alik: Okay, next…


Natasha: Do we get some kind of result? Something like this?

Zhenya: Just praise. Thanks everyone…!

18:40

Alik: Aaaand [PH] D Church nine.

Zhenya: [PH] D Church nine.

Alik: This is [PH] D Church nine.

Natasha: [singing] [UI]

Zhenya: So, [PH] D Church nine is nine, right?

Alik: Yes. Nine.

Zhenya: And we didn’t just do nine?

Alik: We did eight.

Zhenya: Ah, yes [UI]

Zhenya: A) “Who are you?” Right?

Alik: Mhm.

19:10

Zhenya: Member… Komsomol member?

Alik: Komsomol member?

Zhenya: Me, yes!

Alik: Seriously, right? 

Zhenya: I made it…

Alik: I just wanted to ask…

Zhenya: Komsomol.

Alik: Ahh.


Alik: Should I read you all the questions or do you get it?

Dasha: Yes.

Zhenya: Well, yes, because… Essentially, of course I can…

19:39

Alik: [reading the questionnaire] “Do you know who is connected with whom in this project?”

Dasha: Out of the six of us or the twelve of us?

Alik: No, in total in the whole project. [PH] Project Track. So, I know everyone. Who is with whom. Then [reading the questionnaire]: “I was able to forward the correct messages very quickly throughout this project and I have a solid understanding of how everyone is connected.”
That is similar to the first question.

Dasha: But how are we supposed to know the Chicagoans, for example? Fine, we’ll…

20:09

Alik: Well, we know how we are connected.

Dasha: Yes.

Alik: We discussed it here.

Dasha: What about the Chicagoans? That’s totally…

Alik: Well, we don’t know. So, say that. I don’t know. There is a choice here, actually. And the last one, the fourth [reading the questionnaire]: “I essentially revealed who was connected with whom and how on my own during this project.” Okay, next… Shall we read the next one?

Nastya: Mhm.

20:36 

Alik: So. Now we answer about your small team. Your disciplinary. So, about your three… several… Okay. But it’s the very same question. So [reading the questionnaire]: “I know who is connected with whom on this small team. I forwarded letters quickly. I understand well who is connected with whom. And… I figured out who is connected with whom and how on my own.”

21:12

Alik: Next… Same questions, but about [H] Red Force. Fill it out.


Zhenya: But this is wrong here…

Natasha: Oh, they are sly! They’re going to check us after!

Zhenya: I changed my mind.

Dasha: I don’t understand what we need to do here. Ah, drag.

21:42

Dasha: Sedimentologist, this, operator…

Natasha: Who is…

Zhenya: And what should we do here?

Alik: What questions do you have?

//Dasha: [UI] materials…

Zhenya: What should we do with sedimentologist?

Alik: Are you there already? Just a sec…

Zhenya: You still aren’t there?

Alik: Ah, okay now I’m there. Good, so…

Nastya: The sedimentologist didn’t have to choose me. I chose him but he chose…

Alik: So, who was this sedimentologist connected with? Who were his two people?

22:14

Dasha: Should we pick two?

Natasha: So, this. Ah…

Alik: No, you can pick four people, two of which were his. It’s up to you. If you know…

Nastya: No, look… I chose him, but he didn’t choose me.

Natasha: Yes, this we apparently choose while// we guess who they were writing to.

Zhenya: We need to drag, right?


Alik: Huh?

Zhenya: We need to drag them there?

Alik: Yes, drag them and they’ll go right in.

Dasha: Who were you, Zhenya?

Alik: You can even remove them. If you made a mistake you can remove them from the window.

22:40

Zhenya: Terrain.

Dasha: Terrain.

Alik: Terrain.

Zhenya: Terrain. Terrain.

Alik: Terrain is you.

Zhenya: Ah, you can remove it.

Alik: You can remove it if you made a mistake.

Zhenya: I need to put myself here, right?

Alik: Well, it says here: “Whom did the sedimentologist choose?”

Zhenya: So, I think he chose me.

Natasha: Whom did the sedimentologist write to first?

Alik: No more than four people in the window.

Natasha: Did you remember?

Alik: Well, he is definitely in Chicago, right? The sedimentologist.

Natasha: Mhm.

23:14

Nastya: Oh, I don’t know. I guessed…


Natasha: Yeah, you can’t guess here…

Alik: It’s tough, it’s tough…

Alik to Ryan: Any idea, Ryan?

Ryan: For the other people – no.

Alik: Yeah. It’s kinda tough.

//Ryan: We’re gonna have to look it…

Zhenya: Two is enough, right?

Alik: You can even do four. If you guess two out of four, it will still be right.
