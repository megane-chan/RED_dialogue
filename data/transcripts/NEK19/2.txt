Natasha: [UI]

Zhenya: There’s a button here.

Alik: Give me that paper.

Natasha: This one?

Alik: Yeah… Okay, so… Project Red design overview. We need to look again at…

Zhenya: Overview that one, right?

Alik: Ok, //ready?

Ryan: //One, two…

Natasha: Design overview, right?

Alik: Mhm.

Natasha: [UI]

Alik: Ryan, what are you saying?
 
00:33

Ryan: I don’t have any…

Natasha: But Dasha’s wearing headphones.

Dasha: I’m listening.

Ryan: It’s all I got.

Video: [UI]

01:01

Video: Project Red has two tasks. The first task [UI]. The second task is to [UI] within the task force. We have identified eight different regions [SL] online where water used to be, and you can see in what order.

01:29

Video: You will investigate each of the locations [UI] Project Red [UI] project. [UI] the development of the water infrastructure leading to establish [UI] on Mars.

02:01

Video: The critical discovery of underground water resource will be our direct project goal. [UI] to explore the possibility of [UI] clean water to the [UI]. As you can imagine [UI] water resource [UI] and fresh clean water is critical to the [UI]

02:28

Video: Your Project Red task force will have to pick members of your series group as well as the members of question analysis group. Due to the complexity associated with [UI] on Mars various areas of expertise are represented across the task force. For example, in your astronaut group you will discover an expert in one of the following areas. Planetary geology, engineering, space robotics, [UI]

02:56

Video: Back on Earth the remaining members of the task force are also experts in these four areas. This way the twelve number Project Red task force will utilize [UI] across four areas of expertise to accomplish three overall task force objectives. Your task force has three objectives: First -water yield. This is the amount of water that will be available for [SL] each of your colleagues. Ideally, each human will receive twenty gallons of water per day.

 
03:26

Video: Second- water quality. This is the percentage of water that is contaminated [UI]. Contaminated water is unusable. The contaminants can be removed through the filters. Third is usability. This is a measure of how accessible the water is to [UI]. [UI] the number of people who can access the water. The well should provide the sustainable amount of water to [UI]. However, excess water will be considered waste.

03:56

Video: In order to accomplish these three objectives the task force will need to consider a variety of factors including the water yield in various locations, the amount of contaminants in the water in the particular area along with [UI] contaminants, the accessibility of the region to future human populations and the [UI]. One important thing to keep in mind is that disciplinary team [UI] task force. [UI] set of the factors.

04:30

Video: Individual team objectives are likely to [UI]. [UI] utility information about your specific area of expertise and the tools you use to achieve your objective. We are [UI] on the serious task force to work together to achieve your objectives. This mission is a critical first step towards establishing [UI] Earth-independent colony on the Red planet. We thank you for being a critical part to this important project.

05:00

Nastya: Has the water boiled yet?

Zhenya: What do we do now? Exit, right?

Alik: Yes, we exit and watch the individual video. Now we watch individual, yes?

Ryan: Mhm.

Alik: With headphones. //[UI]

Natasha: Everyone watches their own video, right?

Alik: Yes, one video.

Dasha: Ah, it’s the same, then? What we already watched.
 
05:34

Alik: [UI]

Natasha: Why not? I can’t hear anything.

Zhenya: Turn the sound on.

Zhenya: What do we do?

Nastya: It boiled. Hot water, please.

Zhenya: What? Cold water?
 
Nastya: Hot water.

Dasha: Do we have to watch the video each time? I dozed off a bit.

Zhenya: How much do you want? Full?

Dasha: Yes, more.

21:09

Dasha to Zhenya: Enough.

Nastya:  Thank you.

Alik: Okay, next. Let’s get familiar with this application.

Nastya: This snoozer? [In source text “application” and “snoozer” rhyme and this is a play on words]

Alik to Ryan: I am just going to explain what this is about…

21:32

Alik: So this is the Mars group. Mars analysts. We haven’t talked with them for two weeks now. They did something that had an outcome. So… Today we have forty-five minutes to reach an agreement and sign about the new approximate place where we want to work. So… How is this different from last time?

22:03

Alik: This time we’ll have a five-minute pause…//So they will [UI]

Nastya: //Delay.

Alik: Yes, a delay. And before that we’ll have to plan everything and think about how we are going to communicate with them… There is a questionnaire. So, the first questionnaire we do after ten minutes of work, and the second after twenty minutes, then thirty minutes, and so on.

22:31

Natasha: That’s what we did //last time.

Alik: //Yes, and before we check the final boxes to sign there will be five minutes left and they will tell us it’s //time to sign.
 
Dasha: //Zhenya is responsible for time.

Zhenya: //[UI]

Alik: //Probably… There… We’re basically repeating the same thing, but here we already found a place. Here are the coordinates. [To Ryan] These are the coordinates. You don’t need to keep looking for them.

23:00

Natasha: Are they already going to be entered somewhere? Or should we just take paper from here //and write them down?

Alik: We can just find these ones, eighteen coma fifty, find them somewhere and see what our data is… that’s it. So, we already have a place. We already did that.

Natasha: Where are we going?

Alik: And that’s basically it.

Dasha: And the guys from the first group need to find this place, I guess.

Alik: We already did.

Dasha: What about the guys from the first group? What are they doing?

Alik: What are they doing now?

Dasha: Yes.

23:31

Zhenya: They’re looking.

Ryan: //What is the question?

Dasha: //They are looking for a place…

Alik: Ah, the geologists, right?

Dasha: Yes.

Zhenya: //[UI]
 
Alik: It doesn’t say that they are somehow separate here. //We’re all working together.

Natasha: //[UI] we’ll see.

Ryan: //[UI]

Zhenya: Of course, now we have //[UI]

Alik: //Yes, installed… So, next we watch the group video… Ryan, we’ll watch the next one [UI]

24:01

Zhenya: Which one is that?

Alik: Ryan is going to start it now.

Natasha: There in Training Video?

Zhenya: //Everything is fine…
 
Video: We charged our first flow of water //[UI]

25:01

Dasha to Alik: //But do you have it?

Alik: //Yes, yes [UI]

Natasha: Why is it stopped?

Zhenya: The voice went away.

Natasha: It went away for me too…

Dasha: Well, it didn’t stop for me.

Natasha: Okay, anyway…

Zhenya: This is what I wrote to the geologists:OK. Is that okay?

37:03

Zhenya: “Sent” means “sent”.

Alik: What is OK?

Zhenya: OK and that’s it.

Alik: //[UI]

Ryan to Zhenya: Here you need to select three…

38:30

Zhenya: Mhm, any.

Ryan: Yes… [UI]…location…plus…//[UI]

Nastya: // But why are they landing here? For the stone slab?

Natasha: Oh, here it goes…

Alik: Well. No. It just says a flat place.

Nastya: Yes, but there are rocky stone layers. [UI]

39:03

Alik: Well yes, that’s good, that’s flat. That means we can land there.

Nastya: But he doesn’t absolutely need to land there. [UI]

 
Alik: Well, there is no major difference.

Ryan: For the first one, internal parts will be used by meteorologist specialist.

Alik: Internal parts?

41:57

Natasha: No, I’m looking at [UI]




42:35

Dasha to Alik: Let me look…

Alik: Mhm…

Dasha: No, there’s another one there, where the coordinates are.

Natasha: [UI]

43:08

Natasha: And you don’t need to respond to the hydrogeologist specifically //[UI]

Ryan: I already did.

Natasha: You already did?

Ryan: Yes.

Nastya: I want to make a joke, but…

Zhenya: Joke away.

43:39

Ryan to Nastya: Go ahead.

Zhenya to Nastya: Don’t be shy.

Natasha to Nastya: Come on, come on, come on.

Nastya: These are the longest five minutes I’ve waited for a message from [UI]. I wrote so long ago.

Zhenya: Well, he just can’t check his messages right now.

Alik: He left the room.

Zhenya: When he’s finished writing his paper, he’ll be back Oh!

Nastya: Remember, it’s just a five-minute difference.

Dasha: Well yes.

Natasha: You’re writing in the triangle, right? Not in the hexagon.

 
Dasha: Well, no. In the chat.

Natasha: Well, yeah. In the chat where you see the triangle or over there with the hexagon?

Dasha: Triangle, and inside the hexagon.

Natasha: Yes, there, there.

45:43

Natasha: Did you pick this for the first filter? Oy, what do you have, for the pipes?... Pipe materials, right?

Dasha: Yes, yes. But I only have a pipe and its width. I picked the pipe, and the width:let me think.

Natasha: We’ll see now…

46:11

Natasha: Do you write “choose’ with two O’s? Why didn’t you write with double O?

Dasha: Because it’s past tense.

Natasha: So…

46:39

Dasha to Ryan: Are you hiding something from me over there?

Ryan: Hm?

Dasha: You keep using your hand…

Dasha: Less is better?

Alik: Yes. To use less materials.

Dasha: [UI]

50:33

Alik: Well, do you know the diameter, the size?

Dasha: I’m talking about “five restrictions.”

Alik: Where are they, here?... [UI]…// [UI]

Dasha: So, you’re saying //less is better, right?

Alik: Yes, from a materials standpoint. The less materials you use, the cheaper everything will be.

51:02

Dasha: Okay, then I’m changing //[UI]

Zhenya: Swap it for polyethylene.

Alik: Dasha changed everything three minutes ago.

52:03

Nastya: Maybe you’re looking at him?
 
Alik: You, there… In forty-five minutes [SL] change of decision directives.

Dasha: I didn’t change anything. I’m just entering.

Alik: No, I’m not saying that. The system is counting it. You checked the box there…

Nastya: //And that means “max possible population”? Ryan, what does it mean?

Ryan: It means how many people you could get water to. In that sense.

52:30

Natasha: And these I guessed…

Nastya: //She wrote “Hi” to me.

Alik: Ah, here, I get it. This one…

Nastya: Why [UI] if I chose it. Oh, it’s five minutes delayed. That’s why.

Dasha: Why is no one answering me? I’m a bit…

Alik: Five minutes passed a long time ago.

Dasha: //Yes. Not in the general chat… Are they sleeping? Maybe they [UI]

Ryan to Alik: You change it every time. Unless you are the materials specialist.

53:01

Alik: I’m about to do it right now for the first time.

Ryan: You are the materials specialist?

Alik: Me.

Ryan: Yea. It keeps saying that you changed the drill and the filter. //[UI]

Alik: //Oh yeah.

Nastya: Ok. I put my data and it //doesn’t show it.

Alik: They didn’t think [SL] I need to register.
 
Dasha: How many minutes ago did we start all this?

Zhenya to Dasha: //They won’t write you today.

Natasha:  //[UI] still not this…

Dasha: Sixty.

53:31

Zhenya: They aren’t writing me today.

Dasha: Ah, it just came.

Nastya: What did I do wrong? I entered my data, and nothing is changing.

Alik: …

Nastya: It doesn’t show up here. I did the processing speed, //[UI[

Dasha to Natasha: //[UI] you heard that [UI]

Natasha to Dasha: //Well, you just said it, right?

Alik to Nastya: I think you should go up over there.

Nastya: Yes.

Alik: Go up, more. There. Select yourself and check the box.

Nastya: No, it’s sign off.

54:01

Alik: Well, that’s right. Sign off:that’s your data. You’re saying, “I am ready to propose everything to you with these data.” I just did it myself…

Natasha to Dasha: Did you get my message?

Dasha: Yes, I see it.

Alik: Ryan, now do you see mine?

Ryan: Operations specialist [UI], Drilling specialist.
 
Nastya: Sign off status:no. Should be decisions. Change the [SL] coordinate duty blah blah blah.
Ah, we have sign off.

Dasha to Natasha: He wrote to you again, right?

54:31

Natasha: I wrote… Or did I not write? Aluminum.

Dasha: Also?

Natasha: Yes.

Nastya: So, tell me when you make changes.

Dasha: We just enter in the graphs what can be selected, and it automatically changes above.

Natasha: //It changes?

Nastya: //Mine doesn’t change.

Dasha: Yes, these data change for me.

Natasha to Dasha: But did yours change?

Dasha: I have forty-four there now. Where [SL] five restrictions. What do you have?
After the coordinates, mine says name, and then the [SL] five restrictions line.

Alik: Yes, but here someone is Mars meteorologist now…

55:01

Natasha: //[UI]

Nastya to Alik: No, //[UI]

Alik: Look here, the most important thing for me is how much this will all cost. Right now, it’s two hundred seventy-one, //right?

Nastya: //[UI]

Alik: And if I change it here drill [UI], for example. I changed it, right? And it immediately gets cheaper: //one hundred eighty-one.
 
Nastya: //Yes but look. I entered these data sixteen thirty-five. I entered them here. I entered everything correctly.

55:31

Alik: Did you click the checkmark?

Nastya: Yes.

Alik: I don’t even have a checkmark… //update…

Ryan to Zhenya: Good?

Zhenya: Yes.

Alik to Nastya: And what is this?

Nastya: That’s //[UI]

Alik: Maybe you shouldn’t work with that, but with this?

Nastya: Ho, this [UI], yes.

Natasha: Dasha, we’re changing the input.

Alik to Nastya: Well, change something right here. Change it and we’ll see what… any…

Dasha to Natasha: She wrote to me there too. I’m looking now. But my //numbers aren’t changing.

Alik to Nastya: Well, go up now.

56:05

Alik to Nastya: There look:it became seventy-five.

Nastya: No, it doesn’t appear here.

Alik: But I don’t know if it appears for any of the others.

Zhenya: Anastasia, does that bother you?

Nastya: Well, I think something is working for everyone…

Zhenya: You look at me… It’s all working.
 
Nastya: Okaay…

Ryan: Who is the operation specialist?

Nastya: Me.

56:36

Alik: Nastya.

Nastya: [UI]

Ryan: I just saw you sign off, so congratulations.

Nastya: He told me to do that.

Ryan: Now you’re not.

Zhenya to Alik: Are you chief of panicking?

Nastya to Ryan: Do I need to sign off?

Ryan: If you are ready to in your heart, then…

57:04

Alik: //[UI]

Nastya: //In my heart… Nobody replied to me //so I signed off…

Ryan: //Oh, you’re grieving…//Did you text back?

Natasha to Dasha: Our biomechanical engineer isn’t working, right?

Dasha: //Well, yes. I said he did a good job and now he’s not doing well at all.

Natasha: //[UI]

Zhenya: We answer these questions, right?

Alik: Yes.

Nastya: //[UI]
 
Dasha: //Twenty minutes has already passed, right? It went by tens…

Alik: They gave us ten minutes, yes. That’s the second one already, right? //So, soon…

Ryan to Nastya: //[UI]

Zhenya: Thank God.

Alik: And no one has written anything else in the chat?

57:32

Dasha: No, one person wrote to me…

Alik: //Ah, he wrote?

Nastya: //Who?

Dasha to Nastya: Just a second. I think yours.

Nastya: //[UI]

Alik: //Nastya’s boyfriend is writing to Dasha. That’s it.

Nastya: He is like my brother so… ok. I approve. Dasha is good choice.

Dasha: Yes, but he stopped responding. Apparently, he was mistaken…

Natasha: He’s a slut…

58:01

Ryan: Mars is already turning into reality TV show. //This is like the series: who is with whom.

Alik: //[UI]

Ryan: [UI]

Dasha to Natasha: But we’re leaving aluminum, right?

Zhenya: We’re switching over to cast iron.

Dasha to Natasha: We’re leaving aluminum?
 
Natasha: Yes.

Alik: //That will be too heavy…

Nastya: //How do you say “cast iron” in English?

Dasha: //We don’t change our data.

58:31

Alik to Nastya: Cast iron, //cast iron. Belarusian…

Natasha: //[UI]

Zhenya: Cast iron [diminutive form].

Nastya: [UI]

Alik: [UI]

Natasha: And what do you have for output now?

Nastya: We won the war with cast iron.

Dasha: Maybe she’s just sick and stayed home?

Natasha: Please confirm that the crew [UI]. Well, come on.

59:02

Alik: Ryan, //]UI]

Ryan: //[UI]

Dasha to Natasha: //Did he write to you first? //Water statics, right?

Natasha to Dasha: //Yes. //Is that you?

Ryan to Alik: //Hydrogeologist…

Dasha to Natasha: //That’s hydrogeologist.

Alik to Ryan: //It’s Dasha, right, no?
 
Ryan: No, she is //[UI]

Dasha: //[UI]

Alik: Ah, you [UI]? And that’s hydrogeologist?

Dasha: Hydrogeologist is the one //not writing.

Alik: //Not for us.

Dasha: Yes. He’s not responding.

Nastya: Basically, it doesn’t display for us. That’s here, right? [UI]

59:33

Ryan: //[UI]

Alik: //[UI] so not ...

Dasha: I think there were some numbers before that they wrote you…

Nastya: //But where?

Alik: Ah, they’re asking me to remove…

Ryan: You’ve made your selections and then signed off.

Natasha: //I didn’t write anything…

Dasha: I also didn’t write anything.

Alik: //Oh, fine. I’ll go away.

Nastya: Go away?

Alik: No, she is telling me: “Please remove your checkmark.”

Dasha: Why did you leave a checkmark? You can see the others //didn’t.

Alik: //I was ready, and she isn’t ready yet and didn’t put any checkmarks…

Zhenya: She’s slow. [UI]
 
01:00:04

Nastya: //[UI]

Alik to Nastya: See, she… //The others there can’t…

Dasha: //There, I think… Yes, no one can. Not just her.

Alik: Ok.

Zhenya: //[UI]

Dasha: //What’s that?

Ryan: They probably read them like…

Alik: But who is mechanical engineer?

Natasha: Me.

Dasha to Natasha: Ah, you?

Natasha: Yes.

Dasha: //Ah, we have biomechanical.

Alik to Natasha: //But what did you do?

Natasha: I didn’t do anything… //[UI]

Ryan: We should //[SL] reject this…

Alik: //She started everything over again…

Nastya: //She is entering some kind of…

01:00:34

Natasha: Yes. But what happened? I [UI]?

Zhenya: Everything is gone.

Ryan: Alik, you just choose your selections and then hit the checkmark?
 
Alik: Yeah.

Zhenya: //What do we do? //Click OK?

Natasha: //[UI]

Ryan: How many do you have? How many do you have?

Alik: //I selected everything.

Ryan: //I have one box that I did.

Natasha and Nastya: //[UI]

Natasha: I don’t understand, are you excluding me from the team?

Dasha: No.

Alik: No, we were told there, //that you were responsible for everything from the beginning.

Ryan to Zhenya: //Chose…

Natasha: Yeah?

01:01:04

Dasha: What do we start first?

Alik to Dasha: Reset: //you need to reload this…

Dasha: I understand, but technically, how do I?

Nastya: Why is this, shoot…

Natasha: But I can I enter something here on mine, for example? No, I can’t.

Dasha to Natasha: //Why can’t you?

Alik: //Maintenance…

Natasha: //Ah, no, I can.

Alik: //[UI]
 
Dasha: //You can. You should enter [UI] and sixty.

Natasha: In Sign off…

Alik: Sign off, yes.

Natasha: Sing [sic] off.

Dasha: I don’t know what this Sign off is.

Natasha to Dasha: The Sign off tab. Not [UI], but in Sign off.

01:01:33

Nastya: Can you see why //[UI]

Dasha: Ah, everything should be automatically entered.

Natasha: //No, not automatically.

Nastya: //[UI]

Ryan: It’s service [UI]

Zhenya: //[UI]

Dasha: //No, there, probably, if we confirm the data with our checkmark…

Nastya to Ryan: //That’s what I was asking.

Natasha to Dasha: //Ah, I confirmed it.

Dasha to Natasha: Not me, wait. I’m waiting for our girl to respond.

Nastya to Ryan: So you put all the decisions actually here. //Not on the right…

Alik: //Zhenya is overworked.

Ryan: [UI]

Alik to Dasha: Headphones? Ah, paper? //I gave it to you.

Ryan: //[UI]

 
01:02:06

Dasha to Alik: Ok, fine.

Ryan: Wattage is three hundred fifty thousand.

Natasha: For some reason I have a minus here. What does that mean?

Ryan: [UI]

Zhenya: //Are you saying they’re doing bad work?

Alik: //Oh, they accepted my decision. Good… they’re clearly tired already. That’s good… What are you laughing at?

Nastya: I just totally //[UI]

Natasha: //[UI] anyway… What tasks…

01:02:36

Dasha: No, I’m all… No…

Natasha: I mean in the chat…

Dasha: There! No…There was one there, but there is no letter here!

Natasha: That’s just how this is: you open what should be a correspondence, and then everything disappears.

01:03:03

Nastya: Cars will be //[UI]

Alik: Ryan, isn’t it negative [UI] or [UI] performance? Isn’t it?

Ryan: Where is it?

Alik: Negative sixty-two thousand.

Natasha: Yeees! //[UI]

Alik: //That’s very bad… You see them up there? [UI]
 
Natasha: Did you build this… [UI]

Alik: If you build it, what losses we will incur.

Zhenya: Where is that?

Alik: The first thing. We have negative sixty-two thousand and change.

01:03:32

Zhenya: Ah, well, no problem. Spilled milk…

Alik: //[UI]

Ryan: //[UI]

Alik: It happens.

Ryan: //[UI]

Natasha: //[UI] pump output and total water output.

01:04:02

Zhenya: Most important:tell me when to put a checkmark.

Dasha: I’m an idiot.

Alik: You need to put it here.

Zhenya: For now, it’s time…

Dasha: Remind me, please, for the video, when I am ready to enter all my data, I click on my name, then I click on the plus? When do I need to click the checkmark?

Natasha: I double clicked on the checkmark at first, then on the plus, then on the checkmark again.

Zhenya: You need to click the plus and the checkmark at the same time.
 
01:04:29

Natasha: And then Task 1 will appear again and this, basically, offers no advantage. Well name give this one.

Dasha:  I did.

Natasha: Well, that’s it. //[UI]

Dasha: //Do you think they fell asleep?

Ryan: [UI]

Dasha: Excuse our engineer, what’s her…

Nastya: Mine also [UI] fell asleep.

Natasha: Right here I can’t change them.

Nastya: Well, fine…

Natasha: We have //one filter.

Nastya: But I tried.

01:05:04

Dasha: Nastya, you’re probably on your way, on a spacious road, in a rut.

Nastya:  Why?

Natasha: Twelve nineteen… [UI]

Ryan: [UI]

Alik: What?

Dasha: Look, biomechanical is here, but she doesn’t respond. She is doing something. She chose one filter, another filter. //But why won’t she respond?

Natasha: //But I only have one filter. 

 
01:05:37

Dasha: No, well I think that’s… about her activity.

Alik: What’s going on? Write to her.

Zhenya: Outrageous!

Alik: Don’t be rude. Just ask her.

Dasha: I didn’t plan to be rude to her… So, what are you saying?

Alik: Can you please reply me the answer.

Natasha: Here is my data.

Dasha to Alik: How do you write “reply”?

Alik: // r-e-p-l-y.

Ryan to Zhenya: //What do you have here?

01:06:06

Zhenya: Everything’s fine, I’m counting.

Natasha: //[UI]

Ryan: //[UI]

Nastya: //[UI]

Alik: Please reply and that’s it.

Dasha: This question?

Alik: Yes. Please reply.

Nastya to Dasha: //Can you pass the nuts?

Ryan to Zhenya: //[UI]

Natasha: And I’ll have ice cream.
 
Nastya: Yeah, no one has eaten ice cream. Get that out.

Dasha: Yeah, I forgot about it.

01:06:35

Nastya: I thought you… didn’t like it.

Dasha: No, I like it. //I just didn’t want to eat it yesterday before training.

Nastya: When I ate it my throat started to swell…

Ryan to Zhenya: //[UI]

Dasha: //[UI]

01:07:05

Alik: So there are fifteen minutes left.

Zhenya: Thank God.

Dasha: We don’t have to do all this. We can place our checkmarks and that’s it.

Alik: Well, when is time there…

Zhenya: I was completely ready by the fifth minute already.

Alik: To place a checkmark?

Zhenya: Yes. Basically, what’s up

Natasha: I have such an important job. I need to fill out four graphs.

01:07:31

Dasha: Mhm, poor thing… But why did it… I only just saw the message, but then I asked her again?

Alik: Well, it’s five minutes, remember? There and five minutes back. So, ten minutes.

Natasha: Where did you see that?

Dasha: She wrote me in private chat.
 
01:08:01

Natasha: And what is she writing?

Dasha: It was sent twenty-five minutes in.

Natasha: What does it mean?

Dasha: Alik.

Zhenya: Don’t be rude yet, but start to…

Alik: No, she wrote // “I am writing to you”.

Dasha: //[UI]

Alik: Yes.

Natasha: Lunch.

Zhenya: Breakfast.

Alik: She wrote on minute twenty-five. That makes sense. So, we have to wait another ten minutes for her to answer if she answers immediately. But that’s no guarantee.

01:08:31

Dasha: So, and now ask what we are doing the first twenty-five minutes.

Nastya : We still have everything…

Alik: We’re cooking nuts.

Zhenya: //Eating ice cream.

Nastya: //Still negative, dang.

Zhenya: What?

Nastya: That’s a price, right? Performance minus sixty-two thousand.

Alik: No, it’s not a money price, I don’t think.

Ryan: //[UI]

 
Alik: So, it’s the inefficiency of our system. In the minus, a huge minus.

Natasha: //I don’t know what to do now.

Alik: //But it’s expensive.

01:09:03

Dasha: But it will be so [SL] smooth, right?

Nastya: I already picked all these high parameters for [UI].

Ryan: //[UI]

Dasha: //Are we ready to sacrifice in the interests of Earth?

Nastya to Ryan: [SL] Boot Dwells.

Ryan: [SL] They didn’t buy that. What is the company that is upstairs?

Nastya: Ah, look room.

Alik: They have money, yes.

Ryan: [UI]

01:09:31

Alik: Well, now we have drilling at one hundred eighty-one dollars per hour.

Nastya: Well, that’s a lot.

Alik: Yes.

Zhenya: Yes.

Dasha: But what are we waiting for?

Nastya: Five minutes.

Dasha: Responses, right?... Her message went away again.

 
01:10:02

Zhenya: Didn’t make it.

Dasha: No, the one I read. I read it aloud.

Zhenya: //Casually…

Alik: And after this everyone will fill out D Church eight and then we’ll watch another //video.

Nastya: //[UI]

Dasha: I may be hallucinating… But that message didn’t get there… Although…

Natasha: //Maybe I took too little. I need more.

Nastya: What?

01:10:29

Dasha: I wrote the reply to our biomechanic that you said. Then she answered. It turns out, her message that I read five minutes later became her message again. Then her message disappeared and now that message appeared with this hydrogeologist.

Natasha: Yes, I’m also confused now/

Ryan and Zhenya: //[UI]

Nastya: I’m not getting an answer.

Alik: //Maybe you’re writing to the wrong place.

Natasha: Yeah, we’re not even writing anymore.

Ryan: //[UI]

01:11:02

Zhenya: //[UI] and these non.

Ryan: Yeah, [UI]. Can you close it?

Alik: Yes, with a delay:it’s difficult.
 
Ryan to Zhenya: The second one you already have [UI].

Zhenya: Pipe?

Ryan: Yes.

Zhenya: Sixty.

Natasha: Is this because you chose cast iron? Is that why no one is answering us?

01:11:31

Ryan to Zhenya: Decisions.

Zhenya: Decisions.

Ryan to Zhenya: Here, and again down here.

Zhenya: And here?

Natasha: Maybe I need to increase the wattage?

Alik to Natasha: Where else? There is two hundred fifty thousand?

Natasha: Yes. That enough? Don’t need it? And the torque? I have sixty-five thousand.

Nastya: //[UI]

Natasha: //I almost… I didn’t extend it all the way, but…

Alik: What could the maximum be?

Natasha: Ninety-nine thousand, and there I think is five hundred thousand.

01:12:06

Nastya: Have you tried, are they there?

Natasha: There is more there, yes, of course… //But it’s useless…

Ryan to Alik: //[UI]

Alik: I think Sign off…

 
Natasha: Can I please have a small slice of apple?

Nastya: Here, take half of mine.

Natasha: Oh, no, no thanks, Dasha.

Nastya to Dasha: Eat this. I’m not… What?

Dasha: [UI]

Ryan: What is “Kusai”?

Nastya: Bite.

01:12:34

Dasha: //[UI]

Ryan: I didn’t know that…

Nastya: Really?

Ryan: Yeah.

Nastya: Kusat [To Bite].

Ryan: Hm?

Nastya: Kusat.

Ryan: Ok.

Nastya: Like “kushat” is “eat”. “Kusat” yeah…

Ryan: Yeah, that’s why I was confused… Kushat, kusat… 

01:13:04

Natasha:So, okay. Why did mechanical engineer only give one filter?

Dasha:Mhm.

Natasha:Why?

Dasha:Last time also //there was only filter.

Natasha://Oy, there were some [UI]… How are you?:are you writing that? Yeah? She isn’t even answering //what you’re writing…

Nastya://And she can’t write to me.

Dasha: And who is this?

Nastya://Operation specialist.

Alik://[UI]

Natasha:They are displayed, but it’s some kind of nonsense…

01:13:34

Dasha:Yes.
 
Natasha://Anyway, some of the messages still haven’t gone anywhere.

Alik://And they will get their [SL] Max role. I don’t see what you’re writing to him. Why?

Dasha:Because she is writing in the chat and not to him, probably, right?

Natasha:Yes… Oh, Look, Ryan, look my remote // is piercing me.

Nastya://He bailed hard.

Ryan:Through you?

Natasha:Yes, through. See, it made a hole.

01:14:04

Alik:It’s piercing her hand.

Natasha:Piercing.

Ryan:That’s fashionable.

Nastya:Fashionable, see, he’s [SL] kidding.

Dasha:Tell me, please, did the crane operator write anything to you?

Nastya:Oh!

Ryan to Zhenya:Terrain specialist.

Zhenya:Mhm.

Ryan:[UI]

Natasha:[laughter] Set her off…

01:14:35

Nastya:Do they check the chats later?

Alik:They check all this.

Dasha:Are you writing something vulgar over there?

 
Natasha:Then write it in chat.

Nastya:Who?

Natasha:You.

Alik:And who else?

Natasha:I also want to know.

01:15:06

Natasha:So, // Martian meteorologist they decided. //Seventy.

Alik://Ryan, did you check responses?

Ryan://I did. From hydrogeologist. Zhenya is monitoring Martian terrain:OK.

Zhenya:Ryan for two…

Ryan:I just said: //Zhenya is watching.

Alik:The key letter… “OK.”

Dasha:And there, mechanical engineer is writing in the window. //Are you not answering or something?

Ryan to Zhenya://Oh, you have a new message.

Zhenya://Yeah? Oh, What’s new, bro!

01:15:39

Nastya:Who?

Zhenya://Ryan.

Natasha://Ryan wrote to Zhenya: “What’s new, bro?”

Zhenya:That’s awesome. //Just like us.

Nastya://Totally. Yes. Are you going to answer?

Ryan:Nothing new.
 
Alik:Nothing new.

01:16:06

Zhenya:We’re sitting [SL] and chilling.

Alik:Has system written that we need to place checkmarks yet?

Natasha:No.

Zhenya:I feel like it’s time. What’s the delay?

Alik:She wrote one time and people placed checkmarks. And then it didn’t work.

01:16:37

Natasha:Then I did //[UI]

Alik://[UI]

Ryan://[UI]

Dasha to Nastya:You wrote that? //Wait…

Nastya://Yes.

Dasha:I see that the hydrogeologist sent that to me. I’m like: Oh, dude, moment!! And then it turns out to be you, probably. [To Ryan] What are you saying?

Ryan:Where?

Dasha://[UI]

Natasha://[UI]

Ryan://Crew data.

Alik:Ah, Zhenya, you’re the meteorologist, right?

Zhenya://No, Ryan is.

Natasha://No, that’s Ryan.


 
01:17:05

Alik:Well, he placed a checkmark. //Then let’s place ours…

Natasha://Well fine, I will too then…

Zhenya:Well I will too.

Alik:Okay, place your checkmarks.

Zhenya://Checkmark, Ok and what else, Yes?

Natasha://You are allowed to sign off anyway…

Zhenya:For some reason it didn’t go for me…

Natasha:Ah, leave me alone.

Zhenya:Ah, there it is.

Natasha:Now it went away for some reason.

Nastya to Dasha:Well, did you like it?

Natasha to Nastya:Ask her in the chat.

Nastya:Look at our dialogue.

01:17:39

Ryan:[SL] You are the geologist.

Natasha:I thought Dasha was on my team.

Dasha to Natasha:I wrote to you, and what did you answer me? //No-thing…

Natasha://You wrote to me about pipes.

Dasha:I didn’t write to you about pipes in private chat. I wrote in the [normal] chat.

Natasha:[UI]

Alik:Wait. Six out of seven checkmarks. That’s us, right?
 
Nastya:Yes.

Alik:So they only have one person left. Right?

01:18:07

Dasha:[UI]

Zhenya://Slowing it down…

Natasha://And for me some reason I…

Nastya://Sedimentologist.

Natasha:Do you have mechanical engineer //checkmark?

Alik://Ah, this right here…

Dasha:No.

Alik:No, I don’t see it.

Zhenya:Mechanical. And where is that?

Natasha:Oh, they started //Analysis groups. Press and put the [UI] if the crew is also ready, we can begin the sign off.

Alik:Ah, someone wrote you? //Well we already decided.

Nastya:Yes, //you placed a checkmark?

Natasha:Yes, do you see my checkmark?

Alik://No.

Nastya://No.

Zhenya://No, no.

Natasha:I am mechanical engineer.

01:18:35

Nastya:Mechanical.
 
Natasha:Are you sure that you have confirmed that all of the information is submitted?

Nastya:Yes, yes.

Natasha:Yes.

Ryan:Yes, yes.

Zhenya:Yes, yes.

Natasha://Placed.

Dasha://That’s it, yes, yes.

Nastya:Yes.

Natasha:last time you did //the same thing.

Zhenya://Now it appeared.

Natasha:It’s all the same.

Dasha:We’re waiting. Oh, biomechanical came to life. Also placed one.

Zhenya:She went somewhere.

Nastya://What, what was that message?

Alik://The only one left is maintenance.

Dasha:Who is that?

01:19:04

Alik://I don’t know.

Nastya://And why do we have hydrogeologist in our correspondence?

Alik://We do.

Dasha:There, that’s what I’m talking about, that it’s displayed for some reason//[UI]

Ryan://[UI]

 
Alik://All correct. That’s how it should be, yes. //Everyone signed already.

Ryan:[SL] // It was expensive.

Nastya://Oh man! We in our chat… there was the hydrogeologist that seen all of that.

Alik://This system did something.

Ryan:[UI]

Nastya to Dasha://I thought it was only you and me.

Ryan:I hope you get //[UI]

Dasha://I couldn’t…

Nastya to Dasha:Yes, I thought only you and I were there.

01:19:35

Dasha:And who is there?

Natasha:Take a room.

Dasha:[UI] I wait.

Zhenya:It’s as if they know what you’re writing there.

Ryan:[UI]

Zhenya://[UI]

Nastya:Good life.

Ryan:I was there, right?

Nastya:[SL] It’s my line. Thank you.

Ryan:Deal with it… [UI]

Zhenya:[UI[
 
1:20:07

Alik:Well that’s it, so, I think we’re done //with this.

Dasha:Thank the gods.// [UI]

Ryan://How long was it scheduled for?

Alik:Forty-five minutes.

Ryan:Do we have the [PH] Relay after this?

Alik:No.

Dasha:I’m very…

Natasha:Now we send letters, //remember?

Alik:No, we do have…

Dasha://[UI]…//why won’t he answer?

Alik://Yes. Well, that’s it, next thing now…

Zhenya to Nastya://Need a spoon?

Nastya:No. It’s just kind of hot.

Zhenya:Don’t hurt yourself.

01:20:34

Nastya:I’m nervous, he won’t answer me.

Alik:Your Max?

Nastya:Yes… So //[UI]

Alik://D Church eight, please.

Zhenya:D chort [Russian word for devil that rhymes with church].

Natasha:Wait, we aren’t going to write letters?
 
Alik:That’s after.

Natasha://We’re doing eight?

Alik://In order, yes. First D Church eight, then one more video, and then we write letters… D Church eight.

Nastya:Oh, he answered me.

Alik:Too late.

Dasha:He answered?

Nastya:No, not him.

01:21:01

Zhenya:So, D Church eight.

Alik: Mhm.

Nastya to Alik:Ah, you sent it to me? Oh, totally fine.

Alik:What?

Nastya:Hi, [UI] we are excited to talk to you.

Alik:Yes, I wrote that.

Natasha:[UI]

Dasha:Well, I like how I have zero percent for the second question.

Nastya:And which D Church are you doing right now?

Alik:Eight, eight.

Nastya:Eight?

01:21:49

Zhenya:Shoot, but who am I? Terrain?

Natasha://So, drilling, yes.
 
Alik://T-Rex.

Dasha:Well the answer is drilling here.

Natasha://No, that’s there…

Alik://No, drilling is not yours.

Dasha:Ah, okay. I see, I see.

Natasha:Ah materials – that was Alik…

Nastya to Alik:Ah, [SL] Sirius ID – so I write ninety-six or //NASA’s?

Alik://NASA’s, NASA’s.

Zhenya:Middle – is that a good answer?

Dasha:Look there, where it says Martian analysis group in brackets – that’s them. Where it says Sirius in brackets – that’s us. So, you can…

01:22:18

Zhenya:So, don’t write where it says Martian?

Dasha:No, write. Just //[UI]

Zhenya://So middle is okay?

Alik:Middle means neither close nor far.

Zhenya:It’s fine…

Dasha:You should be closer to Sirius.

Zhenya:Close where? To the left?

Dasha:To the right.

Zhenya:Ah, well, okay. We’ll put Sirius on the right.

Dasha:Right-left, left-right, right-right, left-right… Mechanical…
 
01:22:48

Nastya:We write Total [SL] trainers, right? Or hardly know because we saw the video?

Alik:Well, yes. We saw the video – you can say hardly know.

Natasha:For me that’s Total [SL] traitors.

Nastya:You think – video.

Dasha:Oh, if only you saw your face when you saw it. When I saw the video… Martian – who is that?

Alik:Hm?

Dasha:That’s Zhenya – Martian?

Ryan:Martian terrain specialist.

01:23:19

Zhenya:Terrain is me.

Dasha:Mhm.

01:23:46

Natasha:Same exact questions.

Zhenya:Ah, so you don’t have to say here.

Alik:Yes, if you don’t want to do that, you can skip it.

01:24:16

-

01:24:38

Natasha:It’s great how they made all the questions out of four letters.

Nastya:Who did you like?

Dasha:He laughed at your…
 
Nastya:Answer.

01:25:08

-

01:25:32

Nastya:Yes, he wrote it was cool to work with us.

Alik:Who?

Nastya:Max.

Natasha://I doubt it.

Dasha://You pronounced his name so elegantly.

Nastya:Yes.

Dasha:You chose him because he was the only man there?... I just… I’ll keep that to myself.

01:26:09

Nastya to Alik:You’re writing agree everywhere, in our team too?

Alik:Me?

Dasha:Strongly. //Ah, in your internal team?

Nastya://No, that’s for robotics.

Alik:Yes, exactly. No, I wrote “Somewhat agree.”

01:26:37

Natasha:Incompatibility.

Dasha:Incompatibility… What other word did we have today? It was also long.

Alik:Inseparable.

Nastya:Inseparable.
 
Alik to Dasha:One more time?

Dasha:Yes.

Alik:Inseparable.

Dasha:I don’t know how.

Alik:Inseparable.

Nastya:Just say “separate” and add “in.” In-se-pa-ra-ble. //”in” and a-b-l.

01:27:08

Dasha://Inseparable, inseparable, inseparable.

Nastya:Inseparable twins.

Natasha://So that works like [UI]. //Am I understanding that correctly?

Dasha to Nastya:That’s if you have more than two inseparable friends.

Nastya:Mhm. What do you mean more than two?

Dasha:Well, like if you have two people, then you can use… What is it?

Alik:Two peas in a pod.

Dasha:Two peas in a pod. And if you have more, then peas don’t work anymore.

01:27:38

Nastya:Why are you writing everything about [UI]?

Dasha:These are your friends.

Zhenya:Well, that’s it.

Nastya:How should I know what they’re doing? 

Natasha://[UI]

Zhenya:Those are not //[UI]
 
Nastya:Who knows? //No idea.

Alik://They don’t know anything at all.

01:28:23

Zhenya:So, now there’s a video, right?

Alik:Yes, now the video, then ten minutes of those //letters.

Natasha://[UI] Questionnaire answers //[UI]

Alik://Then we’ll wrap up finally.

Natasha:[UI]. So, should I keep doing this or not?

Alik:Well, you need to finish, yes.

Natasha:Well, I thought maybe I had to wait for something here…

Zhenya:You should have asked me. I did that already.

Alik:A long time ago.

01:29:15

Natasha:They are really detailed questions, just look!

01:29:43

Natasha:[UI] I don’t know, honestly.

Dasha:Three letters in each line here: who, what, well, with… And you don’t understand the question at all, and also…

01:30:10

Natasha:I’m not proud of this questionnaire, honestly. If… I’m not going to the bathroom with a mic on.

Nastya:Did you hit your head on me or…

Natasha:No. [UI]

 
01:30:54

Dasha:Everything we did was expensive, right? But good, luxury… [UI]

01:31:22

Zhenya:Yes, Ryan, you already learned Russian.

Nastya:What else did he write?

Zhenya:No, I’m just… He’s got it down.

Nastya:With Latin characters, right?

Dasha:No.

Zhenya:In Russian.

Nastya:Is there a Russian keyboard?

Dasha:Yes.

Nastya:Are you serious?

Dasha:It’s true.

Zhenya:It’s written there.

Dasha:Igor set it up, I think.

Ryan:What?

Nastya:We have Russian //[UI]

Ryan://Keyboard. Oh yeah.//[UI]

Nastya:I thought you wrote it in English… but //Russian…

Ryan://Cyrillic.

Nastya:Ok.

Nastya://Relay too.

Dasha:But we’re logging out of this one…

Alik:…Just minimize it for now.

Ryan:[UI]

Zhenya:Just minimize.

Alik:Yes, just minimize for now… The next one is in the folder Project Red, training and videos.

Zhenya:Project Red training?

Alik:Yes. Then  training.

Zhenya:Training videos?

01:32:28

Alik:Training videos and there will be Project [SL] ray…

Nastya://[UI]

Natasha://But I can close this, right?

Zhenya://[UI], yes this?

Ryan:Yes.

Dasha:We minimized it.

Natasha:Good. Tell me one more time, please, which folder?

Dasha:Training videos.

Natasha:Training videos.

Dasha:The last one, right?

 
Alik:The last one. //[UI]

Natasha://Project [UI] overview.

Alik:We’re listening.

01:32:58

Natasha:But we know that.

Alik:Yes, it’s only three minutes. [UI]

Nastya:What? Where do I click? I’m not going to make it.

Alik:Project Red.

Nastya:Relay?

Alik:No, you’re in the wrong folder. Pick another folder.

Nastya:Which one? This one?

Alik:-Yes, Training, training videos and this last one.

01:37:12

Natasha:We’re working with the old plan, right?

Zhenya://But who remembers it?

Dasha://Yes, but I thought next time we were picking from our left. Next time I think that won’t happen//[UI]

Natasha:[UI]

Dasha:Well, when we somehow replay the second one.

Zhenya://And what? Where does it go?

Alik://So, we go in Pro…, oh wait, just a second…

Dasha:Project Red? Project Red [SL] Relate?

Alik:No – crew data. Crew data, Project Red.

Dasha:Project Red [SL] relate.

Alik:Yes, that’s it.

Nastya:What are we closing?

01:37:42

Zhenya:Where again? Project Red?

Dasha://[SL] Relate

 
Natasha://Crew data.

Alik:Crew data.

Natasha:The folder [diminutive].

Alik:Project Red, Project Red [SL] Relate.

Zhenya:Project red, project red… but I don’t understand something…

Alik:We pick ourselves out of these pictures.

Natasha:So, now who do we pick?

Alik:Ourselves.

Nastya:Yes, I get that.

Natasha:Mechanical engineer…

Alik:And then we need to pick two people like we //did last time.

Natasha://You pick me and… Now we’ll find out who.

01:38:14

Alik:Yes, let’s find that out.

Natasha://And one of the Martians.

Alik://We’re not choosing anything  yet.

Dasha to Alik:Well, you can pick Nastya.

Alik:Yes, I’ll pick Nastya //and also…

Natasha://And I’ll pick Zhenya, and Zhenya picks…

Alik:Ryan.

Natasha://Heard that song before…

Dasha to Ryan:I am fluid engineer.
 
Nastya to Alik://But who was Max? //Structural geologist?

Dasha to Alik://Who are you here?

Alik:I am materials.

Dasha://Ah, materials.

Natasha to Nastya:You should choose me.

Nastya:Yes, I chose. And who was Max? Structural geologist or…

Natasha://I don’t know…

Alik://Maintenance.

Zhenya:Still need someone?

01:38:44

Natasha:And we need to pick one of Martians.

Zhenya:One of the Martians?

Natasha:Mhm.

Nastya:I picked hydrogeologist.

Dasha:Who?

Nastya:Hydrogeologist.

Dasha://Ok.

Natasha to Nastya:Who did you take?

Nastya:Hydrogeologist.

Natasha:She took hydrogeologist…

Dasha:So, you take structural.

Ryan:Structural, sedimentologist

 
Zhenya:And I should take sedimentologist?

Dasha:I’ll tell you right now. Sedimentologist, you have maintenance, I have biomechanical, which I didn’t want. [To Alik] You have drilling.

Alik:Drilling?

Dasha:Drilling specialist.

Alik:She’s already on our team with Nastya.

01:39:14

Natasha:It doesn’t matter. She’s a Martian.

Alik:Well, fine.

Nastya -That it?

Zhenya:Next?

Natasha:The main thing to remember…

Alik://Yes, click “Next.”

Zhenya://Myself, Ryan and sedimentologist.

Natasha:Yes.

Alik:So each assignment will be ten minutes.

Natasha:Who had hydrogeologist? Did you have hydrogeologist? //[UI]

Nastya:Yes.

Alik:Ah, wait. We need to wait five minutes, right?

Dasha:Why?

01:39:44

Alik:That’s what I think. If we send them something.

Dasha:No. Ten total.

 
Alik:So, when does it all end?

Zhenya:For some reason I have one in my inbox and there’s nothing there.

01:40:17

Natasha:[UI] maintenance. Who has maintenance? Who?

Dasha -Ryan does.

Natasha:Ryan does?

Zhenya to Ryan:Sedimentologist?

Ryan:Mhm.

Natasha:Then this is for Ryan. And who has biomechanical?

Dasha:I do.

Natasha:Then that’s also for Ryan.

Dasha:I think we shouldn’t have said it and spoken to each other, but when there are no cameras… Sorry.

Ryan to Zhenya:Yes, to me.

01:40:57

Zhenya:Who is the geologist here?

Dasha:Structure? She has it.

Zhenya://So, that means…

Natasha:Yes, I have structure. And I’ll also send it for Nastya. Nastya has the hydrogeologist. I tried to send it through the Martians, but they sent it back to me.

Alik:Hydrogeologist…

Natasha://We’ll have to send it around the circle.

Alik://Not good…
 
Natasha:I tried to pick the easy path.

01:41:30

Alik://And sedimentologist?

Natasha://So, earlier… Oh…//this is ours…

Zhenya://So, drilling around the circle too.

Alik:Drilling is our guy.

Zhenya:So, I correctly…

Natasha:And there, look, I wrote directly to you…

Zhenya:And hydrogeologist.

Natasha:Nastya has hydrogeologist.

Dasha:[UI]

01:42:02

Natasha:Now she’ll give us equal joy… Biomechanical, hydrogeologist, mechanical. So, this goes here.

Zhenya:Yes, here…

Natasha:Oh, and here.

01:42:37

Nastya to Natasha:Did you assess how I braided her hair?

Natasha:Yes, very cool. Much better than last time.

Nastya:There are three now.

Natasha:Yes, they are so big. Pretty.

Nastya to Natasha: //Who has structural geologist?

Natasha to Nastya://We do.

 
Dasha to Alik://Oh, so good. Both are for you.

Natasha:Sedimentologist… I have it.

Nastya:Mhm.

01:43:07

-

01:43:30

Natasha:And no one had drilling, right?

Alik:I did.

Natasha:Too far… Well, we’ll try.

Dasha:So, when Zhenya sent it to you… Lap of honor…

01:44:00

-

01:44:31

Natasha:Fine, it didn’t work… So, we’ll have to do the circle… For this mechanical… dude… Today the Martians are totally useless… Oh, this is for Dasha… [UI]

01:45:04

Dasha:Very interesting business… I wish the second one would start.

Natasha:Something came here…

Zhenya:Biomechanic.

Dasha:Me.

Natasha:Maybe next time someone will take two of ours and someone will take the Martians.

Zhenya:Fluid isn’t ours?

Alik:It’s ours.
 
Dasha:That’s totally me. I just have biomechanic, and fluid is me.

01:45:39

Alik:And now I have it too [UI]

Natasha:[UI]

Dasha:Oy.

Natasha:Actually, what is pumps, it’s not clear what it is [UI]

Nastya:She [UI] is waiting?

01:46:05

Natasha:Well, we thought we’d somehow do it different next time.

01:46:24

Natasha:Oh, someone from your circle came to me.

Alik:Ryan, do you know if this e-mail [UI]?

Ryan:This is all we did.

01:46:55

Alik:This is stupid. Their point?

Ryan://If there is… if there is a second [UI]

Dasha://I have for you…

Ryan:If there is a second part to it or some random, I don’t know… I don’t know about it.

Alik:[UI]

Nastya:I’m not the only one who have inappropriate…

01:47:40

Ryan:Alik has structural?


 
Natasha:I do.

Dasha:Alik is drilling specialist.

Ryan:Mhm.

Natasha:Let’s pick the second one straight away, so we don’t have to worry about it.

Dasha:Right now, yes. For the next one.

Natasha:Well yes, yes, I mean don’t even enter the names of the Martians.

Alik:Alienate them entirely.

Natasha:Who are they, anyway?

01:48:16

Natasha:Thank you.

Zhenya:They haven’t understood anything for a long time.

Dasha:Who? Them?

Zhenya:The Martians.

01:48:39

Natasha:[UI]

Dasha:Please give this to the operator… And take some for yourself.

Alik:Change?

Dasha to Alik:Did you receive there [UI]?

01:49:09

Alik:I’m throwing it all to Nastya.

Dasha://Well yes, because she [UI]has it. Personal.

Natasha://[UI]

 
Alik:I don’t know. I gave everything to Nastya.

Dasha:Even if you have it, you’re still going to send it around the circle, right?... Two, One!

Alik:I didn’t have time to send the last one.

Natasha:And I didn’t either. It came at the very last second.

Nastya:Can I run to the bathroom?

Alik:So, there are ten minutes left.

Nastya:Well, it’s fine, if there are ten minutes left.

01:49:39

Dasha to Nastya:Run for it… //We’ll wait for you.

Zhenya://Choose again?

Ryan:All of us pick Max.

Alik:Max?

Ryan:And Nastya.

Nastya:What?

Ryan:All of us should just pick Max and you.

Alik:Everyone pick Max and send him all the letters. //And only to him.

Nastya://Why to him? It’s not his fault.

Zhenya://Who else there, [UI]?

Nastya:It’s all my fault.

Ryan:We’ll keep sending the whole group. At the same time.

Dasha:According to the same scheme, right, for everything?

Natasha:Mhm.

 
Nastya:Yes.

01:50:09

Nastya:I already forgot who I have.

Dasha:You have hydrogeologist.

Nastya:Yeah. I just can’t remember which one he is. //Structural geologist or hydrogeologist.

Zhenya://Beautiful. Decent.

Natasha:Oh, here we go! So fast!

Nastya:Shoot, I was kidding. He’s actually //[UI]

Natasha://No one took you seriously.

Alik:So pudgy.

01:50:45

Natasha:I can’t even sit anymore.

Zhenya:Look – they won’t get it like that.

Dasha:So, you want to leave?

Zhenya:Yes, retire… So, I forgot – fluid is who //Nastya?

Alik:That’s Dasha, //Dasha.

Dasha://That’s me.

Natasha://Dasha.

Dasha:All you have is fluid. Not, not that… Hydrogeologist…

Nastya to Alik:Did you [UI]do that?

Alik:Yes.

 
01:51:16

Nastya:[UI]

Alik:Breathed… [UI]

Natasha:Well, I don’t know.

Alik:There’s some music there.

Dasha:Mikhalich, I have something for you.

Audio:Meteorology specialist Session C has logged out.

Alik:Ryan, what was that?

Ryan:If you right click on anything on the screen, it will read out loud.

Zhenya:It just reads it out loud.

01:51:50

Nastya:Where did you click?

Alik:Right click here. And read out loud.

Natasha:[UI]

Nastya:For slow learners.

01:52:11

Nastya:Ryan, why aren’t you wearing a vest?

Ryan:[UI]

Dasha:[UI]… nakie, pudgy.//Cut that out later.

Natasha://[UI]

Ryan:Wait.

Nastya to Dasha:You need to say all that in English.

 
01:52:39

Dasha:I don’t know how to say “nakie.” If you’re right [UI]

Ryan:Nakie?

Alik://Naked.

Dasha:No, I mean “nakie.”

Ryan:¬What about it?

Natasha://Not about you.

Dasha://It’s about you but not naked.

Zhenya://[UI]

Natasha to Dasha:I’m protecting you.

Dasha:No, that’s a fine //word.

Nastya to Alik:Say it.

Alik:Why me?

Nastya:No, how do you say the diminutive version in English?

Alik:Ah, for “nakie?”

Nastya:Yes.

Alik:Naked butt.

Nastya:No!

01:52:10

Dasha:That’s very…

Natasha://Rude.

Dasha://We’re not like that.

 
Nastya:Dasha, you aren’t like that.

Dasha:I held on… How do you say “nakie?” How do you say it nicely?

Alik:I can’t remember right now, Dasha. Seriously.

Dasha:Not what you say to a grown-up, but to kids.

Alik to Ryan://[UI]

Nastya- //To a child.

Dasha:Yes.

Natasha://[UI]

Nastya://[UI]

01:53:42

Ryan:Nakie.

Alik:Nakie?

Ryan:Nakie.

Alik:There you go “nakie.”

Ryan:That’s what you say to a toddler, like… Nakie butt.

Alik:I didn’t even hear that one, so…

Ryan:That is [SL] used more commonly.

Alik:Ok, got it.

Dasha:Nakie?

Alik:Nakie.

Ryan:It’s like a cute way of saying “naked.”

Alik:That’s what they say to children.

 
Dasha:Well, I get it.

Alik:[UI]

Nastya://Just a bit left.

Ryan to Dasha://[UI]

Natasha:Ah how do you say “vest” in English again?

Alik:Vest.

Natasha:Vest?

Alik:Vest.

01:54:14

Natasha:Vest  like “west”?

Alik:No – “V.” Not “west,” but “vest.”

Natasha:Vest.

Alik:“West” is with a “W.”

Nastya:[UI]

Alik:[UI]

Dasha:Ah, I’m an idiot, just like [UI]. [UI].

Alik://[UI]

01:54:42

Dasha:[UI]

Alik:[UI]

Ryan:[UI]

Nastya:My abs are sore from laughing.
 
01:55:20

Nastya:Shoot, when will the video probably be? Today or tomorrow? Depending on how the loading goes.

Natasha:Today we can still do it…

Nastya- Everyone should just wear overalls.

Alik:What?

Nastya:Yes, learn the phrase. I sent it to you. Did you read my radiogram?

Dasha:Yes.

Natasha:I saw it. I just thought I should read it when there is an assignment.

Nastya://You need to learn it.

Dasha:The task has been set.

Natasha:The time has not.

Alik:Zhenya, did you read it?

Zhenya:Well, of course.

Nastya:Yes.

Alik:Did you learn it already?

01:55:50

Zhenya:Long ago. Since the morning.

Natasha://[UI]

Nastya:Ryan also learned it, right?

Natasha://Well, can anyone say anything about this phrase?

Ryan://We wish all participants…

Dasha:My sweety.

 
Ryan:Olympiads… scientific and… crea…

Nastya:Ah, creative, yes.

Ryan:Creative victories… and… a bright future. Future?

01:56:17

Alik:-Future.

Zhenya:Nice job.

Dasha:Who has sedimentologist? //Zhenya?

Zhenya://I do… [UI]

Nastya to Ryan:Do you know what means what Dasha told you?

Ryan:Did she tell me personally?

Nastya:Sweety.

Dasha:Ah, sweety?

Nastya:Did you say that?

Dasha:Sweet, sweety. I don’t remember…

Ryan:Sweet something…

Alik:Yes, sweet.

01:56:46

Dasha:Why do you vulgarize everything immediately?

Nastya:We’re not vulgarizing, there’s nothing to vulgarize…

Alik:No, this is all very nice.

Nastya:Yes… Dasha and I have winter [UI]?

Dasha:Yes.

 
Nastya:Yes.

Zhenya- Take the print-out and hang it up.

Nastya:And how, if… Well, I’m just thinking right now we’ll all just stand up here…

Zhenya:And hang a new one inside and that’s it.

01:57:16

Nastya:Yes, but there will also be those legs…

Zhenya:What?

Nastya:Under the camera.

Zhenya:Well, under the camera. [UI] they do it under the camera. They print it just like that and hang it all right on the Velcro.

Dasha:Shoot, but it’s obvious that eyes are moving.

Zhenya:No, well if it’s hung well under the camera no one will see it.

01:57:35

Alik:But they’ll read it from the disk, right?

Zhenya:They will look at the disks on the side, generally. Of course, it’s visible…

Nastya:Well, anyway, we’ll mess with it and see.

Dasha:Of course.

Natasha:After dinner we’ll do it, right?

Nastya:Of course.

Dasha:Yes. What’s with you?

Zhenya:Saliva will flow on an empty stomach.

Nastya:[UI]





01:58:05

Natasha:I already set it up so that next time not as much goes into this envelope.

Dasha:Oh, no. [UI]… [UI] that on April 12 nothing [UI]

Zhenya:There’s enough of everything without that.

Nastya:Summer will be totally boring, I think. June or something…

01:58:39

Zhenya:I still don’t think they will let everyone off work.

01:59:15

Zhenya:Sedimentologist.

Nastya:Tom Cruise is here…

Natasha:Mhm.

Zhenya:He’s building some underground house for himself.

Nastya:Really?

Zhenya:They showed it.

Nastya:What’s this house? What’s the plan? What’s the point?

Zhenya:Well they’re building practically five floors underground.

Nastya:In case of nuclear war or something?

Zhenya:Yeah. And aliens.

01:59:51

Zhenya:Travolta did a good job. He bought a plane and flies around in peace.

Nastya:I don’t know, what’s up with him?

Zhenya:What?




Nastya:With Travolta.

Zhenya:Well, he has an amazing [UI]. //[UI]

Alik://[UI]

Alik:So, now D Church nine, please.

Zhenya:That’s it? We’re closing it?

Natasha:Do we turn this off?

Alik:Yes, there is nothing after that.

Natasha:Do we remove the mic?

Alik:No, no, no. //First D Church nine, then… //Leave them on for now.

Dasha:So we don’t close the tabs, right?

Alik:We close everything. You don’t need your computer now. //Only D Church nine and then we turn off the recorders/

Natasha://[UI]

02:01:00

Ryan:[UI]. Number nine.

Alik:Yeah, number nine.

Natasha:I love filling out questionnaires with [UI].

Dasha:It’s cool. [UI] too.

 
Natasha:[UI] we really like it.

Zhenya:D Church nine, right?

Alik:Yes.

Natasha:Extraterrestrial… sounds really [UI], honestly.

02:01:47

Nastya:I don’t understand the meaning of this at all…

Zhenya:It’s a very deep meaning… You won’t get it right away… I only started to understand recently.

Alik:Years…

Zhenya:Yes.

02:02:16

Nastya -Shoot, how should I know?

Zhenya:What do we need to do here?

Alik:Middle, you neither agree nor disagree.

Zhenya:No, in this one here…

Nastya://Yes, good? Turn it off?

Alik:Yes. You can turn everything off. The recording…

Zhenya:All of it, right?

Alik:Yes… Remove the recorders… First the red button, then “Stop”- the square on the right, and then you can turn it off.

02:06:04

Zhenya:Do we need to hit the red?

Alik:Well, it doesn’t matter. It won’t turn off without “Stop.”
