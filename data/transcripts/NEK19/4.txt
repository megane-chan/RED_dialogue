Dasha:I’m done. I’m not going anywhere else.

Alik:Ok.

Stefania:Well, I think we are picking the second option [SL] for attaching electrodes.

Zhenya:Where? On the butt?

Stefania:Yes. They said you can put them wherever it’s comfortable, so they don’t interfere with your work. The long-term ones.

Zhenya:On the tummy is stylish, right?

Stefania:Anywhere.

Zhenya to Ryan:Where do you like to put them, bro?

Ryan:Stomach.

Stefania:In the suit you can put it there… It will be on your chest. In your ears – sure. You’ll have headphones in – that won’t be comfortable.

Ryan:Yeah,  yes.

 
00:35

Zhenya:Well, fine.

Stefania:Oh, here we have one more paper. Or did we do that already?

Alik:We did it.

Alik:So. Well, first we log in, sign in.

Stefania:Such a tiresome day today.

Nastya:Mhm.

Zhenya:Well, there is a little. Somehow…

01:06

Zhenya:And what about tomorrow? When we give blood – anyway, probably not [UI]

Stefania:So, we are not Crew [SL] cognition, right? We are…

Alik:No, we’re in the first table. Sirius three and so on.

Stefania:Username…

Nastya:Have we turned on the recording yet?

Stefania:Crew three, right, log in?

Alik:Not yet, let’s log in first. Everyone logged in…

01:33

Nastya:I am so hungry.

Stefania:[UI]

Zhenya:Hungry? //Should we cut this or something?

Nastya://Really hungry! Know what? I want one of those buttery cookies.

Dasha to Zhenya://Yes, lower.

 
Zhenya to Nastya:You want the buttery one?

Nastya:Can you split it?

Stefania:And salty.

Nastya:Ah, Zhenya, the buttery one – over there.

Zhenya:Are these salty?

Stefania:Yes, thanks.

Dasha:Only here there will be a locomotive with [SL] appendages.

Zhenya:We don’t have a locomotive today; we get a helicopter today.

02:06

Nastya:I’ll put this here.

Stefania:Yes, I will [UI] this now.

Nastya:You know where I found the scissors? Next to you over there on the shelf.

Stefania:On the shelf?

Dasha:Take fifty.

Stefania:They don’t smell like fish, so these scissors aren’t from the kitchen.

Nastya:Well, but we don’t wash them.

Stefania:All kitchen scissors smell like fish.

02:38

Dasha:Because you’re always smelling the same pair of scissors.

Stefania:That’s probably the scissors from my [SL] cabin then.

Alik:Zhenya, did you log in?

Zhenya to Ryan:Did I log in, bro?

 
Ryan:Mhm.

Zhenya:Yes.

Ryan:He’s ready.

Alik to Zhenya:Is the recorder on?

Zhenya:Well, I’m ready.

03:05

Alik:Ah, we’ll just turn it on together now.

Dasha:Who wants?

Zhenya:Yeah, come on, already.

Alik:Stef, did you turn on the recorder?

Stefania:What?

Alik:The recorder.

Stefania:Not yet.

Dasha:Take it, take it, take it. Ryan…

Stefania:Not after the salty one.

Dasha:Take it now. Then maybe you can have some.

Stefania:Ah, well fine. Thanks.

Alik:I don’t want any, thanks.

Stefania:It looks very pretty.

Nastya:Team spirit – everyone eats… Come on!

Alik:Yeah?

Dasha:Even Zhenya took some.

 
Zhenya:Yep. //See, I am sitting here eating in disgust.

03:35

Stefania:So girly and pink…[UI]

Dasha to Alik:Well? Command away!

Alik:[UI]

Nastya:[UI] [imitating Alik chewing and talking]

Zhenya:[UI] [imitating Alik chewing and talking]

Alik:Three, //two, one! Here we go!

Stefania://Two, one…

Alik:Open the folder Project Red, Training, Training videos.

Stefania:[UI]

Nastya:When I enter [UI]

04:05

Alik:And we turn on the first one.

Stefania:Why did you tell me to put away my headphones?

Nastya:Headphones… [UI]

Alik:Yes, you can listen individually. Just listen – the clock is going.

Zhenya:Yes. That’s the right thing to do.

Alik:First video – Project Red Design Overview.

Zhenya:Okay.

Nastya:This video.

Dasha:And I need your cups.

 
Stefania:Cups.

Nastya to Dasha:Thank you, dear.

04:37

Dasha:Well, somehow it’s not very [UI]

Nastya:Like… Tastes like bubblegum or something.

Ryan:Mhm.

Nastya:It tastes like gum.

Zhenya:Yes.

Stefania:How should it taste? //Amaretto?

Ryan://How do you say that in Russian?

Nastya:Zhvachka [gum].

Ryan:Zhvachka.

Alik:Gum. Chewing…

Stefania:Zhevat [to chew].

Ryan:Zhevat.

Stefania:Zhevat, mhm.

Ryan:Mhm.

Stefania:Okay, Project Red Design Overview, right?

Alik:Mhm, we’re watching the first video.

Stefania:[UI]

Nastya:Coffee is almost ready.
 
05:09

Zhenya:Zhevat.

Alik:Mhm. Can you cut me a slice?

Ryan:Yeah. Take this.

Nastya:No, later.

05:37

Stefania:Thanks.

Dasha:Seven fifty.

Nastya:Thank you.

Dasha:From you – seven.

Nastya:What?

Dasha:Nothing.

06:07

-

06:39

Nastya:So good.

07:09

-

07:26

Dasha:Alik, everything okay?

Zhenya:He’s just engrossed.

Alik:Yes, such verse here.

 
Ryan:What’s funny?

Nastya:He… [imitating Alik]

08:03

Alik:Okay, let’s work. Let’s work.

Dasha:Alik, watch the video.

Zhenya:Watch, [UI].

08:33

-

09:02

Dasha to Alik:I’m not covering anything //with paper for you?

Zhenya://So…

Alik:Did you like it?

Zhenya:Sort of…

Alik:You can watch it again.

Dasha:Actually, the more you watch it, the more interesting it gets. It overtakes everything.

Zhenya:Yes.

Stefania://What?

Dasha:You won’t understand all the films the first time.

Stefania:How did it end? Who is the killer?

Dasha:Don’t spoil it, don’t spoil it.

Zhenya:Ah, something isn’t clear.

Stefania:So, it was the butler, right? I saw that one.

 
Zhenya:Yes, there is one.

Dasha:Shows on Channel One. [Pervy Kanal:TV Channel in Russia]

Stefania://Yeah, right!

Alik://After this video, when we finish watching it, we watch the individual video. In the same folder.

09:35

Zhenya:Terrain specialist.

Alik:Mhm.

Stefania:Oy.

Alik:Here you can take a nap for fourteen minutes.

Zhenya:Oh, yes.

Nastya:Shoot, what else is there to eat?

Stefania:What?

Nastya:Anything else to munch on? For some reason I’m really…

Zhenya:We have those things… What are they, //chips.

Stefania://Salty snacks… Maybe these rings?

Nastya:No, something sweet.

10:02

Stefania:Or take some chocolate. Chocolate is there.

Dasha:Did you all have pictures here?

Stefania:Like these.

Dasha:The pictures are pretty on the last tab.

Zhenya:You can look later. Now we watch the film, and then…

 
Alik:We’ll look at the end of the project.

10:32

Nastya to Alik:Can I?

Alik:Yes, of course.

Stefania to Nastya:Help me make sure I do two things: a medical check for Ryan, which I  have tried to do five times today, and running on the treadmill after my sixth cracker.

11:07

Nastya:Still [SL] Touch and then…

Stefania:[SL] touch…

Nastya:Ah, that’s tomorrow…

Dasha:This was all recorded, so you can listen.

Alik:What is this?

Zhenya:Twenty fourth, twenty fifth shot…

Alik to Dasha:No, [UI]

11:39

Nastya:The cookies helped me. Went down well.

Zhenya:Which one?

Stefania://The fifth.

Nastya://The buttery one.

Zhenya:Ah, the buttery one?

Nastya:Mhm.

Zhenya:Now they will load all the way…

 
12:13

Zhenya :Is it me or did they just turn off the ventilation?

Dasha:Something happened. I don’t know.

Stefania:Feel a draft?

Zhenya:Well, for some reason the [air] circulation is weak.

Nastya:Sometimes…

Zhenya:The noise is gone, right?

Dasha:Yes,  yes, yes.

Nastya:Sometimes that happens.

Zhenya:Well, fine.

12:57

Nastya:Do I need to adjust my volume after the cookie?

Zhenya:Use the scissors to adjust the sound.

Nastya to Stefania:Don’t worry. Everything is fine.

Zhenya:She got a bit confused.

13:27

-

13:57

-

14:27

-

14:57

 
-

15:14

Zhenya:Mhm… You could put matches [into your eyes not to fall asleep]

Alik:[SL] Stop.

Nastya:We need those glasses with eyes.

Zhenya:Do you need glasses? Maybe meditation beads?

Nastya:We can all sit like this…

15:42

Nastya:Only Ryan would be in normal glasses.

-

16:21

Dasha:Yes so… Could we do that?

Zhenya:Yes, damn it all!

Ryan:I wanna go!

Stefania:Totally awesome!

16:50

Stefania:He changed his mind.

-

17:26

[laughter]

Zhenya:I just did that for you [UI]

Dasha:No, not because I [UI]. I see [UI] like an air freshener [UI].
 
Zhenya:Excellent. These muscles already hurt for me.

17:52

Stefania:Oy, [SL] very soon.

Nastya:Coffee helped too. Woke me right up.

Stefania: Lucky you.

Nastya:And cookies. You know, it sent my glucose in the right direction.

Stefania:Sent… your blood sugar…

Dasha:And what are you all having here?

Nastya:I’m having some nuts… Do you want chocolate?

Zhenya:Hope I don’t hurt my mouth here. [from yawning]

18:31

Nastya:You should have put this in [UI]

Alik://Project Red…

Zhenya://Right. It’s probably like this there…

Alik:Already complete…

Nastya to Dasha:You know, it’s like they caught a mouse in the corner, and he’s like: … It’s all good.

19:03

Nastya- All good, Jerry.

Stefania:I can’t do more.

Nastya:Did you finish all the… blood?

Stefania:Well, yes.

Zhenya:And are you ready for tomorrow?

 
Stefania:Hm?

Zhenya:Are you ready for tomorrow?

Stefania:I finished today’s for tomorrow. It’s still not finished – we’ll say halfway.

Dasha:We need to get up early… I have //bio…because I have to give [UI] blood.

19:34

Stefania:It says in the assignment: blood samples at seven forty.

Dasha:You won’t have time to take…

Stefania:At seven forty.

Zhenya to Dasha:What do you have?

Dasha:I have the components [SL] for the methodology for [UI]

Zhenya:And we need the first what? Ingredient?

Dasha:Mhm. Blood.

Stefania:And there will be saliva tomorrow too, right?

Dasha:Yes.

Zhenya:At seven forty, there…

Dasha:Well, saliva is…

Stefania:Well, for composition, meaning, the saliva you make…

Dasha:Yes.

Zhenya:Then let’s start at seven.

20:03

Dasha:Well, by seven, yes, we need split up.

Nastya:When? Get up at six thirty? At six?





Stefania://At six thirty.

Zhenya://Well, to have time. Can we [UI] tomorrow?

Dasha:After saliva. I’ll give them saliva. There’s also… saliva at two.

Stefania:Well, just the four of us, and the guys can’t.

Zhenya:There we go again. We don’t count anymore.

Nastya:And we don’t need to do it?

Stefania:You are the day after tomorrow.

Zhenya://Well, then let’s get up at seven, and slowly…

Dasha://[UI]

Nastya:What-what?

Zhenya:Yes.

20:35

Dasha:So everything is faster.

Zhenya:The only thing is – then before seven all those [SL] TM, THM there, all those… Med checks need to happen right away. We’ll wake up at quarter till and everyone will do that… And we also have to do urine.

Nastya:[SL] What about urine for Alik and I?

Zhenya:What about it?

Dasha:What, [SL] do we pour the urine into something?

21:04

Stefania:That would be hard to [SL] cystitis…

Nastya:No, well, I can do it if I need to…

Zhenya:No, I’ll do it without any beakers…

 
Stefania:Right into a syringe…

Nastya to Dasha:And when do you want to start the composition [for saliva]?

Dasha:At seven.

Nastya:Oh, then I’ll get up at six thirty.

Zhenya:Why?

Stefania to Nastya:You don’t need to do that.

Nastya:I’m going to help her.

Stefania:Ah, are you helping?

Nastya:So it’s faster.

Stefania:Electrodes,. all of that?

Nastya:Mhm.

21:33

Dasha:You’ll do that for me tomorrow…

Stefania:Okay.

Dasha:I don’t remember who the operator is behind the program…

Stefania:Okay.

Dasha:Maybe it’s even you.

Zhenya:Well, all of this is critical tomorrow… Basically, [UI] in your hands… The main thing is to eat… Let everything else shift…

Dasha:Well, we can’t eat until we give blood.

Zhenya:Well, that’s why… essentially…

 
22:04

Stefania:Yes, we’ll have time… Tomorrow we don’t need to rush anywhere. Breakfast is recorded [UI]. But we’ll make it to breakfast.

Nastya:That’s at eight twenty, I think, right?

Stefania:Yes.

Zhenya:No, I mean about our bodies. I didn’t say anything about the sound. We’ll see. We’ll warn them there is little time, and anything else…

Nastya:They’ll be woozy in the tunnel after giving blood.

Zhenya:Pale.

22:33

Nastya:Curdled milk, curds…

Stefania:I think we’re already trained. We can produce it really fast now…//[UI]

Zhenya://Well, I think, yes. Everything is different for us.

22:57

Nastya:Are we on duty tomorrow?

Stefania:Hm?

Nastya:Yeah, tomorrow we’re on duty… I’ll get it from you in the morning…

Stefania:Yes, yes we’ll have time.

Dasha:I feel like we’ve talked so much but this video won’t end.

Alik:Well, it’s fourteen minutes…

Zhenya:No, it’s all good…

 
23:27

Nastya:We remember everything. Don’t think we’re ignoring it. We’ve just already memorized these instructions.

Dasha:We need seven minutes to complete the assignment.

Stefania:Yes.

Nastya:Everyone awake over there in Chicago yet?

Dasha:I don’t think so… They’re also sitting… Shivering.

24:01

Zhenya:No, I think Maximillian is just now parking his bike… With a lock…

Alik:He is saying that Max is parking his bicycle. He is running upstairs to the video room.

Ryan:Run! Run!

Dasha:That’s dangerous.

Nastya:Soapy nuts?

24:31

Stefania:Ryan, did you run?

Ryan:No.

Stefania:You didn’t? Will you go tonight? Afterwards?

Ryan:Yes, //after.

Nastya:Yes.

Stefania:You’re on [UI]?

Ryan:Yeah.

Alik:Done?

Zhenya:Mhm.

 
Alik:Okay, next, there is a folder on the desktop: “Crew Data.” Crew Data and then Project Red, and in there [SL] Utopia Plantation V3. These videos. This is about what we’re doing today.

25:08

Dasha:Oh, I saw the picture…

Alik:Ryan, did you get that?

Ryan:Yeah.

Dasha:[UI]

Alik:Our friends.

Nastya:Maxwell.

Zhenya:Mine won’t load.

Stefania:Mhm.. It’s like they are doing a direct connection. So, it’s lagging…

Zhenya:Well I can see Maxim on Ryan’s screen. He has appeared.

Ryan:Server is overloaded.

25:38

Alik:Mine is working. Yours is not?

Dasha:Everything is fine.

Zhenya:They only appeared recently for me. And it’s still loading.

Stefania to Nastya:Same thing, right?

Zhenya:Well, it doesn’t matter.

Alik:Well, I will tell them.

Nastya:It’s the same thing. Introduction is the same thing. They scroll and then… This cut out and then they give a new text based on new locations. Like we recorded everything at the very beginning…

 
Stefania:Well, I don’t have any text, so…

26:10

Nastya:You don’t have anything?

Zhenya:Oh, I just saw Maxim appear.

Alik:Oh.

Stefania:Well, sort of, yes, //just one word at a time.

Zhenya://And it froze.

Stefania:Apparently, Zhenya and I have the same data transfer channel… Which doesn’t work.

Zhenya:Mhm… Well, Ryan’s is frozen too…

26:38

Ryan:Maxwell…

Stefania:Maybe someone can summarize for us later?

Dasha:Everything is fine. They’re alive and healthy they say.

Alik:Smiling.

Zhenya:Asking for pumps again, probably…  those jocks.

27:07

Alik:Pumps and stones.

Stefania://[UI]

Alik://Ryan, you don’t have it either?

Ryan:It’s freezing [UI]

Alik:You, Zhenya and Stefania?

Stefania:Yes.

 
Alik:I will tell them about this.

Dasha to Alik:Why don’t you listen to them?

Alik:I see them.

Zhenya:[UI]

Alik:I’m reading their lips.

Nastya:Reading their lips…

27:42

Zhenya:At least I know who is who now. Maxwell – structural geologist.

Alik:He said it for the fourth time.

Zhenya:I’m slowly starting to learn.

Nastya:I like her glasses. //Cool frames.

Alik://[UI]

Stefania:Yeah, I like them too.

Zhenya:Whose?

Nastya:Sheila’s. Sedimentologist.

Alik://Crooked neck?

Zhenya:We also have Max.

Nastya:I say “Sheila Christy,” and he says: “crooked neck?” [evidently someone thought these two phrases sound similar in Russian]

Alik:Well, okay.

28:11

Stefania:Well there is something about her, //[UI]

Nastya:Something with her neck…

 
Alik:Crooked, crooked neck…

Stefania:I wonder how old she is.

Alik:The one with glasses…

Stefania:Can I still say she’s [SL] hot?

Zhenya:I think it’s too early.

Nastya:So the name is Sheila Christian of the girl, and he was: “crooked neck.”

Alik:I misheard. I didn’t know what she said.

28:42

Nastya:[UI]

Zhenya:Oh, Max changed for me… Hanna…

Dasha:Want me to tell you what will happen?

Zhenya:Who? Me?

Dasha:I’m already on the last one.

Alik:Spoiler.

Nastya:Oh, a new one! This, this one…

Zhenya:Which glasses? Hanna’s?

Stefania:No, Shi Christina’s.

Zhenya:[UI]

Alik:Sheila.

Stefania:I like the name Hanna.

Zhenya:It’s German.

 
29:12

Dasha:Your little – Japan… oy, Chinese woman from Mars.

Zhenya:Ah, is she also Hanna?

Stefania:Yes?

Zhenya:Maintenance specialist. I will understand who to write “OK” to there.

29:49

Stefania:Oh, did that change already?

Zhenya:His name was Valery.

Dasha:Not everyone said that…

Zhenya:Drilling specialist.

Alik:Mhm, that’s ours.

Zhenya:Mhm… drilling.

Alik:She is the most fun.

Zhenya:Mhm.

Nastya:Ok, what do we need next?

30:17

Alik:Next, in the same folder we launch the program called ‘Project Red Design.’ So, in the same folder you click on that link.

Stefania://Can I take off my headphones?

Zhenya:Project Red Design, right?

Alik:Project Red Design, yes.

Nastya:And what was the password there?

Stefania:This long one that we all wanted to copy down…

 
Alik:Zhenya, I think Ryan kept the password for you last time, so you wouldn’t need to type it again.

Stefania://Yes.

Zhenya://Yes?

Alik:Yes, //now it will be easier.

Zhenya://But where?

30:46

Stefania:Where is it written?

Ryan:You remember? Let me see.

Zhenya:[UI]

Nastya:And what’s the login?

Alik:Yes, it’s CON or something…

Stefania:Here, here, here…

Dasha:Open the presentation. The presentation //has everything.

Nastya://I know. I was just too lazy to stretch.

Dasha:No, not here. The presentation on the computer in the same folder //[UI].

Zhenya://Right here…

31:15

Nastya:[UI]

Zhenya:[UI]

31:48

Stefania:What is the //input data?

Alik://Everyone logged in?

 
Zhenya://Not yet.

Dasha:Seventeen forty-nine.

Alik:Correct.

Stefania:Correct?

Alik:That is our square today.

Stefania:How did Dasha know?

Zhenya:Oh how.

Alik:Seventeen forty-nine, yes.

Stefania://I’m getting a little scared.

Alik://The first thing is writing to them to establish contact.

Nastya:What do we write?

Alik:Just write something so it goes to them…

32:19

Nastya:Create coordinates first, probably, no?

Alik:No. First is contact. Send that out, because we have a five-minute delay. And then the coordinates.

Nastya:And who do we write to?

Dasha:Write to Maxwell.

Zhenya:Oh, thank you, Ryan.

Ryan:Mhm.

Alik:Okay. When you log in, Zhenya, write to someone and then you can go to the square.

Zhenya:To who?

Dasha://[UI]

 
Alik://Write to your team.

Zhenya:Start the chat?

32:51

Alik:Ryan.

Zhenya:Ah, hydrogeologist – Ryan?

Alik:I don’t know who you have.

Stefania:Ryan is meteorologist.

Zhenya:Meteorologist… So, we write to each other, right?

Nastya://Robotics is us, I think, right?

Dasha://[UI]

Zhenya:Ah, do we write to these guys?

Alik:Yes, robotics. //We can’t write to a whole team.

Nastya://[UI]. Your own?

Alik:Yes, you can’t write to your own team.

Nastya:Then we write to the geologists?

Alik:We can just write to her individually.

Zhenya:Structural is not ours?

Nastya:But this one… //Maxwell.

Ryan://[UI]

33:21

Zhenya:I can write, yes?

Nastya:Yes.

 
Alik:Yes, write.

Nastya:Maxwell, hi.

Zhenya://[UI]

Nastya://Who are you writing to?

Alik:Valeria.

Nastya:The drilling specialist?

Alik:Yes, she’s ours.

Zhenya:I forgot “hello”.

Nastya:Hi…

Ryan:What’s our location?

Alik:Oh, seventeen forty-nine.

Zhenya:Do we need to write location?

33:50

Alik:No, that’s the square. Find the square and //[UI]

Stefania:I see you, Dasha. I can see and hear well.

Zhenya:Seventeen forty-nine, right?

Alik:Yes, seventeen forty-nine.

Stefania:Is “in the first channel” or “by the first channel” correct? In communications.

Zhenya:“On the first channel.”

Stefania:“On the first channel?” I see you, I hear you? //Loud and clear?

Nastya://[UI]

Zhenya:Read you five by five.

 
Stefania:How?

Zhenya:Read you five by five.

Stefania:Read you five by five?

Zhenya:I hear you.

Ryan:Read you five by five.

34:22

Zhenya:Forty-nine.

Stefania:Well, okay, here we go…

Zhenya:How do you write “Hi”?

Alik:Hi.

Ryan:[UI]

Zhenya:Ah, like this?

Ryan:Yes.

Zhenya:Space… like that?

Ryan:Yes.

Zhenya:[UI]

34:53

Stefania:Commander [UI].

Zhenya:Sure. Let him know.

Alik:[UI]

Nastya:I like how when he did this with you //[UI]

Stefania://[UI]

 
Ryan:Write this, write that.

Stefania:Like on a rope.

Zhenya:Well such a bro [UI] … You think it’s easy for me?

35:25

Nastya:It’s not easy. I have an easy time? No. Hard, hard job.

Stefania:So, let’s take plastic. [SL] We have plastic here.

Zhenya:So what are we doing now? Already going?

Nastya:I’m just entering “Sign off” right away… If we entered them in earlier, no one saw them.

Stefania:So, here you can [UI]

Nastya:Click “Sign off”.

Zhenya:“Sign off” is what?

Nastya://This up above.

Alik://That’s to sign.

35:55

Nastya:And you enter your solutions.

Stefania:You won’t be able to see how your solutions are changing the indicators.

Nastya:No, but here. Write them here.

Zhenya:Well, here, I thought, we place checkmarks, right?

Alik:Well, that’s at the end.

Nastya:No, that’s at the end. Lower. It’s lower there… You need to enter your solutions.

Zhenya:It’s hard to… Well, anyway, I’ll wait… Lay low… Ah, there, some numbers appeared.

 
36:24

Stefania:Four hundred fifteen thousand is… //[UI]

Nastya://What is that?

Stefania:What is your [UI]?

Nastya:Here, yes, we enter ours here.

36:53

Stefania:Oh. Four hundred twenty-one… Ah, here [UI].

Nastya:Oh, they are active today, listen… They’re all entering [data]. Not like last time.

Alik:Who? Them?

Nastya:Yes.

Stefania:They probably got a talking-to.

Zhenya:[UI]

Alik:Good!

37:24

Nastya:[UI]

Stefania:But who is [UI] anyway?

Alik:Nastya and I are already done. That’s how you should work.

Nastya:Ryan, when you have a chance, can you cut apple?

Zhenya:What do you need? Cut apple?

Nastya:Yes, cut kettle.

Zhenya:Cutlet?

Alik:Cut the kettle.

 
37:55

Stefania:[UI]…Oh, like this…

Alik:Remember that every ten minutes this questionnaire will appear. Ten minutes, twenty minutes, //thirty minutes.

Nastya://It’s ok. I can.

Ryan:I don’t know how to do…

Alik:And the exercise will be forty-five minutes.

Stefania:[SL] Twenty-nine, [SL] ninety-five…[UI]

Nastya:Thank you, bro.

Zhenya to Ryan:What do we have here, anything?

Ryan:Yes, choose…

Zhenya://Like that is okay?

Stefania://[UI]

Ryan://Here.

Nastya:Everything is fine here so far. //[UI]

Zhenya to Ryan://[UI]

Alik:[UI] Yes.

Zhenya:This goes here?

Ryan:Yes.

Zhenya:Doesn’t matter, right? [UI]

Ryan:You need to choose…



 
38:58

Dasha:Stefania, did you pick something?

Zhenya://Something here as well…

Stefania://Yes.

Ryan:Yes.

Dasha:You wrote it?

Stefania:I can enter “Sign off” now… if you want.

Ryan:It’s there…

Zhenya:Above, right?

Ryan:Above.

Zhenya:Here?

Ryan:Click here.

Alik to Nastya:Does that work for you?

Zhenya:[SL] Install?

Ryan:Mhm.

Nastya://It’s [SL] being created for me.

Ryan://It doesn’t matter to me.

39:30

Nastya:It froze [UI]

Alik:Well, I’m talking about this.

Zhenya and Ryan:[UI]

Alik:Maintenance – that’s them.

 
Ryan:So.

Zhenya:Ah, those…

39:57

Nastya:Why do I have this terrible song stuck in my head?... [singing] “White swans…”

Stefania:I don’t know that song.

Ryan:[UI]

Nastya: [Natasha] Korolyova, Stefania.

Zhenya://Lower, right?

Nastya:Remember this song by Dima Bilan?

Stefania:Yes, I remember, but for some reason I don’t remember that other song.

Ryan:You need to choose [UI]

Nastya:What is that you have, gum?

Stefania:Can I also get a slice of apple? Like that half.

Ryan:Like this?

Stefania:Half.

40:29

Ryan:Half.

Nastya:Why so sad, Dasha?

Dasha:Huh?

Nastya:Everything okay?

Dasha://Yes.

Stefania://I took this one. Yeah. Thanks a lot… You see anything?

 
Dasha:Yes.

Stefania:What do you say?

Dasha:OK.

Ryan:What wattage?

Nastya:Oh, but we have…//[UI]

Ryan:Stefania, do you know what wattage? Pump wattage?

Stefania:Four hundred fifty-five thousand.

Nastya:You all entered that, right //[UI]?

Stefania:Four five five zero zero zero.

Dasha:Yes.

41:00

Alik:Four hundred and fifty thousand.

Ryan:[UI]

Nastya:Why do we have negative twenty-four thousand right away?

Stefania:I scattered the work.

Alik:[UI]

Stefania:Well good, like that.

Ryan:Pump wattage…there, lower…

Dasha:Oh, fourteen. Let’s reduce it more.

41:31

Stefania:Just a sec.

Ryan:Pump wattage.

Stefania://Four hundred [SL] one two three.//[UI]

 
Zhenya://This goes here, right?

Ryan:And then a checkmark.

Nastya:Twenty-four again. And before that was fourteen.

Alik:Yes.

Stefania:For some reason they aren’t entering on mine. I don’t understand why. [UI]...Oh, mine is jumping…ah, there.

Nastya:Well, right now it’s negative thirty-four thousand.

Stefania:Is that better or worse?

Nastya:Worse.

Stefania:Worse? Should I go back?

42:00

Nastya:We had fourteen before this.

Stefania:I have [UI]

Nastya:Oh, stop right there. Two thousand, no negative.

Alik:Oh! Now we need them to agree to that.

Stefania:Well, that’s it. They better not ruin anything.

Alik:So, right now we’re in the plus, not minus.

Nastya:Mhm.

42:31

Stefania:[SL] Fifteen [UI] mechanical.

Dasha:Nine thousand.

Alik:Wow! //Now it’s nine thousand.

Dasha://Now I will also…

 
Stefania:Come on. You’re going to get more?

Dasha:I’ll try… [UI]

Alik:Yes.

Dasha:How much now?

Alik:It went back again. [UI]

43:00

Zhenya:Well, no problem, it happens.

Dasha:Apparently that’s the maximum.

Stefania:Forty-six?

Dasha:Yes.

Stefania:Yes? We’re leaving forty-six?

Dasha:Mhm…[UI]

43:32

Nastya to Alik:No one is answering us, right?

Alik:Well, I don’t think it has been ten minutes yet.

Stefania:Well, it refreshes slowly //[UI]

Alik://Yes, for some reason it’s acting funny today… the whole program.

44:04

Dasha:What kind is that?

Nastya:I can bring sweet tea tomorrow.

Zhenya:And at once [UI]

Stefania:Great, we have… forty-five minutes. [UI]

 
44:34

Alik:Who said?

Dasha:Hydrogeologist.

Stefania:Hydrogeologist.

Alik:Ah, there – ten minutes has passed.

Zhenya:What do we need to do here?

Alik:You can select people, or not.

Zhenya:But it’s not working. Ah, there.

Alik:So, who are you relying on.

Zhenya:Ah, relying?

45:00

Alik:[UI]… You need to find and select someone. [SL] I will pick Ryan.

Ryan:Yeah, [SL] I’ve explained it before.

Nastya:You are maintenance, right?

Alik:Who? Me?

Nastya:Yes.

Alik:Materials.

Nastya:Oy, materials.

45:28

Nastya:You are fluid, right, Dasha?

Dasha:Mhm.

Stefania:So she is not choosing me.

 
Nastya:Why not? I know you. Mechanical?

Stefania:Yes.

Nastya:I’m just checking to…

Stefania:That means you didn’t pick Dasha before.

Nastya:I picked her… that’s it, I’m picking Stefania.

Dasha:I know what she’s doing.

Stefania:With my little heart… [UI] in my heart.

Nastya:It’s empty. You know like tumbleweed…

45:59

Dasha:Sometimes they even start rolling…

Stefania:Yes, yes, with the wind...

Nastya:So…

Alik:No one is writing.

Nastya:I almost picked myself here.

Stefania:Actually…

Nastya:Can I do that?

Dasha:After all, I’m good, right?

Alik:Hydrogeologist is Maxwell?

Nastya:No he is structural geologist.

Alik:Ah, structural?

46:31

Alik:But who then…

 
Nastya:Hydrogeologist is the eastern girl. [UI]

Alik:Ah, in glasses?

Nastya:Yes. No, without.

Alik:Ah, the last one? Viktoria, right?

Nastya:Well, the one…

Alik:Ah, yes, yes. She has an accent.

Dasha:Done? We log out?

47:00

Nastya:Oh, okay…

Stefania:Did they not enter them or is the mechanical engineer still entering other filters? No?

Dasha:Well, it’s always the same filter…

Stefania:Ah, it doesn’t say that here… Of course, I’m always entering plastic, but…

Dasha:Today I’m also //[UI]

Zhenya:Oh, hydrogeologist… I don’t know, did he write to everyone?

Alik:Yes.

Nastya:Why did she…

Stefania:Forty-five more minutes?

Zhenya:Forty-five more minutes…

Alik:Thirty-nine minutes.

Zhenya:And who is hydrogeologist?

Dasha:Theirs.

 
47:30

Alik:No.

Nastya:Yes.

Alik:We have drilling.

Zhenya://Thirty-five? And they wrote forty-five to me?

Nastya://No, she means on that side.

Dasha:That is…

Nastya:Not on our team.

Alik:Ah. Well,  they wrote me: “Thirty-nine minutes.”

Zhenya:Why are they different? …I have forty-five for some reason.

Stefania:Maybe that’s the second time they’re writing, and we only read the first one… They want us to fight.

Alik:Yes. [UI]

Dasha:Yes.

48:02

Zhenya:Clever plan.

Dasha:I’m logging out, right?

Stefania:No, well, you need to wait at least, probably, how many minutes?.. How long will we be doing this task? Fifteen minutes? And then log off?

Alik:We’re basically all ready. //We can place checkmarks.

Stefania://Well just so it’s not so fast, in just two minutes…

Dasha:Well, what if we’re just that good? We have nine thousand people!

Alik:It’s already been ten minutes. //Because the questionnaire appears every ten minutes.

 
Stefania://[UI]

Nastya:Ok, then “Sign off,” right?

48:30

Stefania:Ah, so, we sign off and we still have to fill out these questionnaires for forty-five minutes. Like last time.

Nastya:Maybe not.

Alik:No, why not? We need to do all of it. So, //this task. Then there are two D Church. Then there is … Ah, no, there is D Church, then we send letters, then another D Church… and then another two D Churches.

Stefania://Well, last time…

Dasha:[UI]

Stefania:That is one, that is two.

Zhenya:[UI]

48:59

Nastya:Anyway, I will “Sign off” …right?

Alik:Ah, I see, that… Yes, me too…

Nastya://Enough already.

Zhenya://Now what?

Alik:Place checkmarks.

Dasha:Is there a second one?

Stefania:No, I remember last time we sat… And then we…

Nastya:Ah, because they didn’t “Sign off” there. They just stopped… Apparently, they totally overslept then or something… … They didn’t enter anything, remember that?..

Stefania:Yes. And now we have all their data, right?

 
Alik:Yes.

Dasha:If they ruin our record… Nine thousand…

49:31

Nastya:Biochemical engineer…

Stefania:Nothing. Nothing, but he didn’t do one thing.

Dasha:He doesn’t have to choose. //We only have one filter.

Stefania:Yes.

Nastya:Yes.

Dasha:Ryan, please give me some apple. A piece… Thanks.

49:52

Ryan to Alik://[UI]

Stefania://Remember how Aphrodite made the gods fight around the table?

Nastya:Yes, I remember something like that.

Stefania:She sent them an apple and said this apple is for the most beautiful and the cleverest. But she didn’t say who… So, a war began.

Dasha:Who didn’t log out? Mechanical engineer.

Stefania:I signed out, but they kicked me for some reason.

50:22

Stefania:Yes.

Nastya:You have everything.

Alik:That’s it. Now it’s up to them. So, all six of us did it… Their call.

Stefania:Well, they’ll start writing something now.

 
Nastya:Wait for it to get to them…

Stefania:Yeah.

50:51

Dasha:Did anyone write to us?

Nastya:No, no fun messages at all.

Dasha:They are sent out all in a row. That’s no fun at all.

Nastya:What’s up? Did he write something to you?

Alik:He wrote: “Hi. Yes, I am.” But what does that mean?

Nastya:What?

Alik:Or was he answering a question?

Dasha:Why are they writing something to you but not us?

Alik:Well, here everything is scattered out of time…

Nastya:“Hi. Yes, I am” – what’s that?

51:23

Alik:Ah, see, “Hi. Yes, I am” appears here. I mean, here that makes sense.

Nastya:Ah, yes.

Alik:I asked him: “Are you ready to work?” He says: “Yes, I am.”

Dasha:You ask: “Are you ready to finish working?”

Alik:That’s what I should have done, right?

Nastya:Why don’t I write: “We are done.”… No, then what?

Alik:Well, basically, yes. We already made our decisions. So write: “Can you please mark off?”

Stefania://And I can write that, right?

 
Nastya://Mark off or Sign off?

Alik://Sign off…Ah?

51:53

Stefania:But can we, yes that, sort of, in the dialog?

Alik:Well, we’re communicating with them. Everything goes by the rules. They can say that they are ready or not ready. It’s up to them now.

Dasha:They’re sitting there yelling: “No way! Give me plastic!”

Alik:They are standing by the blackboard drawing equations. Equation drawing, brainstorming.

Dasha:“How do those Russians do it?!”

Ryan:They are all: “[SL] How can this be?!”

52:23

Alik:“What’s wrong with these people?!”

Dasha:[UI]

Zhenya:They are wiping their glasses and [UI]

Nastya:And we’re eating here!

Stefania:Eating and neighing. [These words rhyme in Russian]

Zhenya:We already ate all the apples.

Dasha:Oy. I can hear you better like that.

Nastya:No way! Surprising!

52:52

Dasha:I’m an engineer… My ears are sweating.

Nastya:So many pluses.

Alik:That’s good… Is that a smile?
 
Nastya:Yes.

Alik:There is something missing. 

Nastya:It’s like an abbreviated smile.

Dasha:A smiley.

Nastya:Or do you want cool, and then dash and…

53:21

Dasha:Oy, those [UI] … Smells like two thousand three, probably.

Nastya:What?

Dasha://Well, when, remember [UI]?

Nastya://Did you smell the headphones?

Dasha://No…

Alik:I also thought the headphones. These are yours, I guess.

Zhenya:No, that’s right.

Dasha:No, that’s not why. Just colon, dash and parenthesis.

Stefania:Oh, that took forever for me to understand. I remember, my friend showed me letters that her other friend wrote her from Russia. They were quite advanced and already used smiley faces.

53:52

Alik:And you are still in the dark.

Stefania:What is this? What’s with the sticks? Brackets. How? Where? I don’t understand.

Nastya:I studied this language for so long when [UI] from New Zealand. They shorten every English word and, apparently, use the number four instead of the word “for.”

Stefania:Ah, yes, yes, yes.

 
Nastya:And with this. And at first, I received messages and went crazy trying to figure them out: “This here is this, this is this, and this is this.” //It’s a whole separate language.

Alik:There is the letter “B” and the number “four.”

54:22

Stefania:And just “U”…

Nastya:Yes, yes, yes. “Before” is “before,” “before.” And they write ”B” and four.

Alik:Talking about the certain languages in text messages. When early on people were [UI] some language.

Zhenya:And what did they write there? Now thirty-one minutes.

Dasha:Are they writing you the time again?

Zhenya:Well, “Hi, ending…” What did they write there?

Ryan:They are saying to us that we have thirty-one minutes left.

54:51

Alik:Ah, well this…

Nastya:Ah, we also have a clock.

Zhenya:Theirs is hanging right over them.

Nastya:I said that we also have a clock here.

Alik:They probably think we have nothing here.

Zhenya:We have lots of clocks. We can [UI] send them one.

Alik:What now?

Dasha:But why aren’t they writing anything to us?

Stefania:Mhm.

Zhenya:They’re ignoring us.

 
Dasha:They write everything to everyone, but not to us. Only the geologist writes to us.

Stefania:He wrote just one time.

Dasha:The first time. Twice.

55:22

Zhenya:Your team is so unfriendly.

Alik:Oh, it’s been twenty minutes.

Zhenya:Well.

Stefania:It won’t go. I’m telling you, we’ll have to sit this out.

Dasha:Ineffective program.

Stefania:Mhm.

Dasha:Not under our command.

Stefania:Certainly.

Dasha:We should already be digging.

Stefania:I don’t know. I could have brewed tea by now.

55:53

-

56:23

-

56:39

Nastya:Hey, what the heck? My finger was punctured. And [UI] right into the hole.

Stefania:Did they give you something for it?

Nastya:No.

 
Stefania:Don’t forgot to see Zhenya for procedures.

Nastya:Yes.

Zhenya:I have a clinic.

Stefania:Zhenya has a trauma clinic.

Alik://[UI]

Nastya://A sticker…

Ryan:They offer that.

Alik:Yeah. [UI]

57:12

Stefania:Will you take it with you, Zhenya?

Dasha:Why are they only looking at me and Ryan? Look, there are four other people here.

Nastya:So what?

Stefania:Let it be like this [UI]

Alik:She is asking why are the cameras looking at you two only and not the other four people.

Nastya:It’s a compliment. We don’t look very good.

Zhenya:Of course.

Alik:It’s a compliment. You are attractive people, you know.

Nastya:What, doesn’t work like that? Dang, I like… made a nice move there.

57:46

Zhenya:And no one is sniffing the headphones now. Cause they’re like // “What’s with the headphones over there?”

Nastya://[UI]

Stefania:See? I’m not the only one who noticed. [UI]

 
Nastya:Although, should have done it for Alik too. He can also do it…

Alik:I don’t do that…

Zhenya:No, Alik is good at covering himself with paper, like…Hop.

Alik:I read the instructions.

Zhenya:This bro put your badge in my cabin today.

58:14

Alik:Did they get mixed up?

Zhenya:With these… Yes.

Nastya:With the fringe.

Zhenya://With a fringe.

Alik://[UI]

Stefania://How could he confuse that?

Ryan:Sorry.

Alik:You gave hers to the… [UI]

Zhenya:I just noticed in time.

Nastya:He thinks you need more colors.

Stefania:You need a bit of style.

Zhenya:Gray…

Alik:You thought he was in the bad mood. That’s why you gave him that one, right?

Ryan:Just to cheer him up.

Alik:Just to lift his mood.

Nastya:Dasha, aren’t you hot?

 
58:44

Dasha:I remember one Bomfunk MC song when he is… What’s it called?

Nastya:Freestyler.

Dasha:Yes, that’s it. I feel it.

Nastya:And I immediately remember Shnur [Russian pop star] who dances to this song. [UI].

Dasha:I turned it on.

Ryan:Off.

Dasha:[UI]

Nastya:That’s why they’re watching you, Dasha.

Zhenya:Of course.

59:12

Dasha:I turned it on. You’ll see later, when you throw it over, if I was lying or not.

Ryan:[UI]

Nastya:What?

Ryan:No, it’s recording now.

Alik:Yes, I know, but something happened.

Stefania:He, probably, [UI]

Nastya:He is throwing himself now.

Stefania:Word by word: “Throw. You. //Now.”

Nastya://You. They are throwing us.

Ryan:I don’t know which [UI]. Now you…

 
59:45

Nastya:Well, basically, you said: “I will throw you //with all…”

Stefania://Away.

Alik:It sounds very funny.

Nastya:I will throw you off now. //Like from the train.

Ryan://Right.

Stefania://In Russian it…

Zhenya://But it’s easier to say: “Ah-ta-ta!” Like that.

Stefania:Scold with your finger like this.

Zhenya:Ah-ta-ta!

Stefania:No, don’t do that!

Alik://They are recording all this right now!

Nastya://[UI]

Ryan://I have no idea what you said.

Alik:Ok, we are being recorded.

01:00:15

Ryan:I have no idea what she said.

Alik:They have [UI].

Stefania:No, please. It’s too much. No more “Ah-ta-ta!”

Dasha:I’m not opposed, Ryan.

Ryan:[UI]

Dasha:You don’t have to do it that way.

 
Nastya:You can say : “I’ll throw you off.”

Ryan:I’m not saying anything.

Alik:Yeah, don’t be trapped. Nastya is the [UI] one.

Nastya:Tell me which one. The worst, right?

01:00:43

Alik:No, not the worst.

Nastya:The worst devil  here, no? I have such cool adjectives.

Dasha:Can you find out from Igor, so Igor finds out from [UI] why we’re sitting here? It’s just that we could spend our time more effectively.

Nastya:Yes.

Alik:Well, I…

Dasha://[UI]

Alik://I’ll report all the problems to Igor.

Stefania://[UI]

Alik:Huh?

Stefania:Maybe there are some surveys there…

Nastya:Maybe.

Stefania:Maybe…ah…

Nastya:Come on. Fill it out, fill it out.

01:01:14

Stefania:I’ll be back soon. Just a sec. One minute.

Alik:Ok. Go ahead, go ahead.

Dasha:No one can see you.

 
Alik:Now she can do whatever she wants to there.

Nastya:Let’s discuss some things a bit.

Dasha:[UI] and record everything on the voice recorder.

Nastya:What is wrong.

Zhenya:Yes, it still doesn’t matter. Sitting.

01:01:48

Nastya:Where will you wear the sensors from SonoTouch that we should have?

Stefania:Just stick them anywhere that’s free. How many sensors is it? One, two, three…

Nastya:Five.

Stefania:Four…

Nastya:Oh, even more.

Stefania:Five.

Zhenya:Well, this attaches on the left, right?

Stefania:One does, yes. These ones //they go here and…

Zhenya://They can go here somewhere. On the other side.

Nastya:But why do we need them at all? What if we don’t attach them? Why do we need them? Can we not connect them?

Zhenya:They need to be there.

01:02:17

Stefania:You need to connect them because if you don’t, // the device won’t work.

Dasha://What about on the back?

Stefania:Put them wherever you want to. They have to reach, that’s the main thing.

 
Dasha:Well, just put them back – and that’s it.

Stefania:We need them. I’m telling you…//Zhenya’s idea works.

Dasha:I can draw a smiley face for you. //As if…

Nastya:On my back, yes…

Stefania:You just don’t want them to be in the way when you put on your pack…

Zhenya:No, the pack is comfortable. I will put one on this side and one on the other.

Stefania://You can put them all really close together…

Alik://[UI]. So they don’t interfere with your backpack //when you put them.

Zhenya://They should probably be on the chest, //because the pack is there.

Alik://[UI]

Stefania://We will practice.

01:02:49

Alik://Because right now //[UI]

Stefania://Here on your breast will be a large sensor with four electrodes, //which we will stick right here.

Alik to Ryan://[UI]

Zhenya://So, and those electrodes go on the other side.

Nastya://Or, you know, like how you attach a collar.

Alik to Ryan://[UI]

Zhenya://No, most likely one here and the second already here.

Nastya:Can we put it on our belly?

Zhenya:That’s not very comfortable for me.

Stefania://You can put it on your arm if you like.

 
Ryan://I don’t know what [UI]

Nastya:Ah, you have [SL] hair there…

Zhenya:No. Stick it on this side. Just like that and that’s it.

01:03:19

Ryan:If turns on?

Alik:He’s asking: “But how do you know if it’s turned on and works even?”

Zhenya:What?

Alik:This device.

Dasha:You can see it.

Zhenya:Which one?

Nastya:SonoTouch. It is saying. [SL] You can see that.

Ryan:So we are just looking?

Stefania:[UI].  Whatever you turn on you also set up for us.

Ryan:Ok.

Dasha:Why did he only just become interested in finding out when it works?

Stefania:He turned it on for us for two months.

Nastya:No, he thought, not that.

Alik:Yes, yes, yes.

Nastya:You thought it’s a different one, right?

01:03:49

Zhenya:No, that’s the one.

Alik:Again.

 
Ryan:I just want to make sure we know that it’s working.

Nastya:Yeah.

Alik:Yeah.

Zhenya:Is this next to last for us already?

Alik:That means thirty minutes has passed.

Zhenya:Thank God.

Nastya:It’s… They say you need to connect anyway, because if you stick it out it’s not gonna work. So, you just put those sensors wherever you want.

Stefania:Only sensor… Head sensor.

01:04:18

Dasha:At first I liked Project Red. I thought it would be hard to calculate or do anything here.

Stefania:Well, yes, it doesn’t really give information or feedback.

Dasha:We’re shooting on the same goal. [soccer-related expression]

Stefania:I also thought it would be more interesting.

Zhenya:I understood from the beginning.

Dasha:We should have gone with Zhenya.

Zhenya:Why didn’t you ask?

01:04:47

Stefania:I mean, it was difficult, but I thought it would get more complex and would become more interesting when we started doing something.

Alik:They thought it was gonna get more complicated with each session, it’s gonna be more interesting and challenging but it seems like we are doing the same thing.
 
Ryan:It’s not interesting.

Alik:[UI]

Ryan:It was harder [UI]. Maybe it’s different this time. So far, it’s been [SL] pretty easy… Looks like someone checked off.

Alik:They also placed a checkmark.

01:05:18

Dasha:Whoa! Come on! There will be more now.

Alik:Come on, come on, come on.

Dasha:A hundred bucks says biomechanical does this all last.

Nastya:What are we betting?

Dasha:I don’t know.

Zhenya:And I think sedimentologist will. Sedimentologist, I mean.

Alik:Sedimentologist will sign off next.

Ryan:[SL] We got most figured out.

01:05:48

Dasha:Dang. I lost.

Stefania:Go Zhenya.

Alik:And Maxwell is structural, right?

Nastya:Mhm.

Zhenya:Yes, those children over there, they are probably drawing with chalk like this now…

01:06:17

Alik:Are you ready, ready?

Dasha:[UI]//I still lost already…

 
Zhenya://Thirty-one minutes…

Alik:How long have they been sitting there? They are worried.

Zhenya:[UI]

Ryan:[UI]

Alik:To fighting even.

Zhenya:Yes, I think so, with pens and pencils.

Alik:They are fighting.

Nastya:I don’t think I should keep doing this experiment…

Zhenya:Yes, it’s all over there.

01:06:48

Alik:They stopped caring…

Zhenya:Max is already crying.

Nastya:Maybe this isn’t my path.

Alik:[UI]

Ryan:Hydrogeologist.

Zhenya:Yes, hydrogeologist. Who is that there? Maximka?

Nastya:No… Maximka is structural.

Zhenya:That’s also fine. Not bad like that. Good.

Nastya:Maximka – know who it is? Maximka.

01:07:17

Ryan:Maximka. Who is that?

Nastya:“Maximka” – it’s a name for Maxwell.

 
Ryan:[UI]

Alik:[UI] for Maxwell. [UI]…Done.

Zhenya:Done, is it over? So what, did we finish everything?

Alik:Well, yes. Now [SL] I’m restarting my laptop.

Zhenya:We won.

01:07:47

Alik:Ah, a letter came… “Final [UI]…” Ah, they are saying: “Our team is making its final decision and will sign all this very soon.”

Zhenya:That’s what I’m saying. They are finishing up right now.

Alik:That’s hydrogeologist, right?

Nastya:Done, close?

Alik:Ok, now we need D Church. D Church eight. Eight, please.

Zhenya:D Church.

Dasha://[UI]

Alik://You should have closed this.

Zhenya://That’s it, closing.

Dasha:[UI]if they can’t enter when we are placing checkmarks.

01:08:19

Alik:Well, they would write it here. They aren’t writing anything yet.

Nastya:They approved our //calculations.

Alik://D Church eight.

Stefania:D Church eight, right?

Alik:Mhm.

Nastya:Ah Hanna – who was that? Don’t remember?

Alik:Hanna?

Nastya:Yes.

Alik:I don’t remember.

Nastya:Ah, the one we liked? The girl in glasses?

Stefania:Chia.

Alik:Shia Christiana.

Nastya:Who?... Well, whatever.

01:11:42

01:12:16

 
Stefania:Disciplinary team – is that ours…//of three?

Nastya://Trifecta.

Alik:Three people.

Stefania:And Project Red then- this…

Alik:All together. //Twelve people.

Stefania://And then Martian Analysis Group://that is only theirs.

Nastya://Them.

Alik:Them. Yes.

Nastya:How should I know what they have there…

Alik:Hm?

Nastya:[SL] I don’t understand anything about these… [UI]

01:15:14

Nastya:What?! Internet… Did I [UI] for nothing? No!

Alik:Try again… [UI]

Nastya:Dang. I completed half of it.

Zhenya:What?

Alik:Try clicking “Next” again.

Zhenya:Did it freeze?

Ryan:Can you refresh?

Nastya:I did half of…

Ryan:Yeah, but it will refresh the same page //if you try.

Nastya://Yeah? Ok.

01:15:49

Ryan:Copy the// address.

Nastya://Refresh… You mean, like, refresh here? Yes?

Ryan:First, copy the page you are on.

Alik:Copy this address in the window.

Ryan:Then try to open new tab and pasting that.

Alik:Mhm.

Nastya:No. No server connection.

01:16:19

Alik:Could everyone else do it? Everyone could, right?

Stefania:Well, I’m still doing it.

 
Alik:Ah, good.

Nastya:I will switch off the Internet.

Ryan:Yeah. Then see what happens.

Nastya:No Internet connection.

Ryan:No Internet connection.

Nastya:Ah, ok.

01:16:49

Ryan:It’s good?

-

01:17:07

Stefania:Mhm.

Alik:Did that go?

Stefania:Yes.

Alik:No problems? Good.

-

01:17:37

-

01:17:57

Stefania:There, I love [SL] Clement.

Alik:Thirty seconds?

Stefania:One-two and ready!

Alik:Yes. Too bad he comes rarely, right?

 
Stefania:It would be better if [SL] Clement was there instead of the matrix. “Check check. Hear me? Orders ready?” …Actually, we’ll have some [SL] porridge tomorrow just for Doctor [SL] Clement.

Dasha:Take a bit more.

01:18:27

Stefania:I’ll take a bit more.

Alik:She said she’s gonna take a little extra [UI] for Doctor Clement [UI]. [UI].

Zhenya:Clement.

Ryan:Reward.

01:18:56

Stefania:Well, it looks like they still haven’t finished, right? Since we still have all the…

Dasha:Why?

Stefania:Project Red won’t sign out.

Nastya:Only one? We don’t need the second one?

Alik:No, //We aren’t doing the second one now.

Stefania://We need to see the window showing that they finished.

Alik:So, next…

Dasha:[UI]

Alik:In the folder where the Training videos were, we open the last video, the one that says //Project Red Relay Overview.

Stefania://And can we close Project Red?

Ryan:You can.

Alik:Yes, you don’t need that now.

Nastya:Oh, I already opened it.

 
Zhenya://Training, what? On the end?

Alik://The last video. Project Red Relay Overview.

01:19:29

Alik:Did you get that, Ryan?

Ryan:Yeah.

Zhenya:So, we watch //the end one, right?

Alik://That’s it. We’re watching.

Zhenya:So, Project Red Relay, that one, right?

Alik:Mhm… That’s it, four minutes.

01:20:00

Nastya:What, [UI] again?

Zhenya:[SL] I’ll show it to Max.

Nastya:You can give that thing to Zhenya to read. The big, bright one.

Dasha:To look at the pictures.

Alik:To keep himself awake.

01:20:31

Dasha:[UI]

Alik:[UI]

Zhenya:Good…

Alik:Cartoons.

Ryan:Good one!

Zhenya:No we do the text messages, right?

 
Alik:Yes, send [letters]… You select two people and the process begins.

01:21:05

Nastya:The old system, right?

Zhenya:Of course… I have this bro and someone else.

Stefania:I don’t know what this is called. [UI] exercises.

Nastya:I’ll do crunches while we sit here.

Stefania:Yes, yes.

01:21:38

Dasha:[UI] what Ryan did at lunch today.

Nastya:Why are you thinking about that all the time?

Dasha:No, I’m just imagining what you’re doing. //[UI]

Nastya://I don’t mess with that.

Alik:[UI]

Dasha:[UI]

Alik:[UI]

01:22:11

Stefania:You’re going to translate for him what we’re saying, right?

Alik:You can translate //that stuff yourselves.

Nastya://Not translate.

Stefania:He understands already.

Dasha:[UI]

Nastya:Everything we said is inappropriate.

 
Ryan:I believe that.

Alik:[UI]

01:22:41

-

01:23:08

Nastya:Dasha, you know who you look like now? Like a person whose life is pain.

-

01:23:34

Dasha:[SL] Hotel.

Nastya:Hurray! Hurray!

Zhenya:So, how many of them are left still?

Dasha:Two.

Alik:He is asking how many more sessions… So, that means in the other folder – Crew data.

Zhenya:We close the video here, right?

Alik:Project Red Relay.

01:24:03

Zhenya:So, now we’re going to Crew Data.

Alik:Crew Data. Where Design was, now Relay is just under it. We click that.

Zhenya:I can’t find it. Crew Data…

Alik:Can you help him find?

Zhenya:Project Red?

Alik:Yes, Project Red, and under that…

 
Zhenya:I found Crew Data.

Ryan:Project Red. Yeah. Ok. Yeah, Relay.

Zhenya://Relay?

Nastya:Whom should I pick?

Zhenya:Ah, this right here?

Dasha:We have me – hydrogeologist…

Alik:Me – hydrogeologist?

Nastya: No, she is //talking with me.

Alik://No, I just forgot.

01:24:38

Zhenya:So, what are we picking? Whose role?

Dasha:Nastya, you are hydrogeologist, then Stefania is structural geologist, you are sedimentologist…

Stefania:He is drilling

Zhenya:I am definitely drilling.

Stefania:Drilling, yes.

Zhenya:I only have “drill.”

Dasha:Okay, you are sedimentologist.

Ryan:Yes.

Dasha:I have terrain specialist. You have biomechanical, and you have drilling, Zhenya.

Zhenya:There. That’s it. We are choosing, right?

Alik:Yes, let’s choose.

Zhenya:So, we, and me…

 
Alik://Two people…

Stefania:You are taking meteorologist and drilling.

01:25:09

Alik:[UI] and “next.”

Stefania:And I am taking you. You are ours. You are terrain.

Zhenya:Yeah. So, now. Meteorologist.

Dasha:[UI]

Stefania:Geologist… //Yes, there is three hundred…

Dasha://You are hydrogeologist, you are structural, sedimentologist, drilling…

Stefania and Zhenya:[UI]

Stefania:There. Right here.

Zhenya:Ah, everything is visible, right?

01:25:39

Alik:That’s all. Here we go. Ten minutes. //There will be two sessions like this.

Stefania://And who has… Who is Material specialist?

Alik:Me.

Stefania:Ah, that’s you.

Alik:Yes.

01:26:09

-

01:26:21

Nastya:Sorry.

 
01:26:42

Stefania:My whole back hurts from sitting.

-

01:27:12

Zhenya:For some reason I’m hungry already.

Stefania:I know why that camera is directed at you… Because that camera is pointed at us.

Dasha:That one is also pointed at us.

Stefania:And that one is also pointed at us. So, everything is correct.// //There are three of them, I guess.

Dasha://We also have one here looking at me.

Alik:Cameras [UI]

Ryan:That one is kind of [UI]. I think [UI].

Alik:Maybe.

Dasha:Because it rotates between me and Ryan. So, it’s not on Zhenya…

01:27:44

Stefania:Does this one turn? //Or that one?

Dasha:No, this one in front.

Nastya:It’s afraid of Zhenya.

Zhenya:I’m not interesting to them.

Dasha:Oh! We are talking here with them. Who is mechanical?

Nastya:// because of you [UI]

Stefania:I am mechanical.

 
Nastya:Ryan won’t have time to run. Stefania and I.

Zhenya:So, we need to run now?

Ryan:Afterwards.

Zhenya:Afterwards. Then I’m going to wash up.

01:28:13

Stefania:I still have ten things to do today. First, I need to do my medical check-up… after running.

Ryan:Ok.

Nastya:After dinner, right?

Stefania:Then I need to do the first-aid kits with you and Alik.

Nastya:Well, if you want, we can do it tomorrow. Do you have time tomorrow?

Stefania:I can do it tomorrow. Yes. But then SonoTouch needs to be brought here today already. //[UI]

Nastya:Ok. //When you go running I’ll get it.

Stefania:Yes…

Nastya:We have a whole day total.

01:28:42

Stefania:Well, I mean, the computer, all of this… The programs, //or what is it?

Nastya://It’s easy, really. I’ll show you.

Stefania:And the programs – is that a separate computer or…

Nastya:It’s a separate computer with the programs. And you need to throw the data on a flash afterwards, when the time comes. When you’re already logging out of the…

Stefania:And leave them on the comp. They will mostly likely request them every day.

Nastya:Ah, there? You need to throw all the data on a flash and [SL] unload them in the next program.

 
01:29:12

Stefania:Yes, but that’s at the end, most likely, they will request specific data. At the end of each day. //Most likely like that.

Nastya://I don’t know. I usually threw everything on a flash, [SL] uploaded it and that’s it.

Stefania:Heavy? How much do they weigh?

Nastya:Yes. They are big. I don’t remember…

Stefania:Well, if they are big you can erase… instead of saving on a flash drive after. They are calling it “Very prompt medical control.”

01:29:43

Nastya:Mhm.

Zhenya:Oy…

Stefania:[UI]

Dasha:I’m not hinting at anything, but I have a message here for Nastya.

Nastya:He is… frozen…

Alik:And I [UI] will sit here like this, and then…

Stefania:You are sending everything to wrong address.

Alik:Before that I didn’t [UI]

01:30:11

Nastya:You know, he has ton of messages and he is waiting.

Dasha:Nine.

Alik:Thanks for pointing it out.

Ryan:[UI]

Dasha:Maybe I also shouldn’t [UI]?
 
Zhenya:Here, I at least see some point in sending letters.

01:30:40

Alik:What? You see the point?

Zhenya:Yes. At least…

Stefania:Ah, the point of that. Yes.

Zhenya:[UI]

Alik:He says he sees more of a point in this exercise versus the one before.

Stefania:We discussed last time the idea behind this letter exchange.

Alik:I still don’t understand the point.

Stefania:Operation – is Nastya. We are taking the long way.

Nastya:Mhm.

01:31:11

Stefania:The point is for us to create a mental map of the connections between participants. So, theoretically, it’s not enough to just send letters around. You should understand…

Zhenya:Understand the big picture.

Stefania:Yes. Who…

Alik:Who is talking with whom?

Stefania:Yes.

Zhenya:You should understand the collective situation.

Stefania:Depending on who… on where letters are coming from… From whom. We follow this line all the way and we can deduce who is connected with whom. And then that’s why you fill out the surveys after.
 
01:31:51

Alik:I’ll ask the same thing next time.

Stefania:When you need to select there who is connected with whom, who is who… What do you think, who added whom?

Dasha:“Did you friend her?”

Stefania:Yes.

Nastya:// “How could you?”

Zhenya://Friends of friends.

Nastya:Yes.

Dasha:“I saw.”

Stefania:How did that go? Remember?

Dasha:Hm?

Stefania:“On Instagram you didn’t like me and you friended her…”

01:32:21

-

01:31:35

Stefania:I don’t get it [UI].

Dasha:I miss Instagram so much.

Nastya:I don’t miss it at all. After the trials. //Not social media. not the Internet…

Dasha://Not the Internet. I miss Instagram.

Nastya:Well, isn’t that a social network?

Dasha:Well…

Nastya:Really… I miss wine… Or maybe I don’t even miss that…

 
-

01:33:16

Nastya:I don’t miss anything yet, honestly. So far… All good… But sometimes I need more Google feeds to quickly check off information. When you write something.

Alik:Yes.

01:33:47

Stefania:Will you let me go for a minute between the first and second tasks?

Alik:Yes, of course.

Nastya:Yes.

Stefania:[UI] studies.

Nastya:[UI] here-there.

Stefania:[UI] to take.

01:34:08

Stefania:I’m not such a high specialist. Far from that level.

01:34:28

Stefania:How did that go: “Daddy, I’m not a real welder.” Do you remember that joke?

Zhenya:No.

Stefania:It’s also not very… We’ll turn the recorders off.

Zhenya:Tell us later. Maybe I know it, but I’m not sure yet.

01:34:55

Nastya:What song will we have this evening?

Alik:Song?

Nastya:Yes.

 
Alik:[UI]

Stefania:But for whom?

01:35:05

Alik:For whom?

Stefania:Yes.

Alik:I haven’t come up with that yet. It is being decided. //[UI]

Nastya://[UI]

Alik:All according to the schedule.

Nastya:Like cats. You know, like…

Alik:Ah, yes. They love that.

Zhenya:What is it called when they do that? Milk step [kneading] or something?

Nastya:Is it? I didn’t know.

Stefania:Yes. //I also didn’t know//

Zhenya://That’s when they… Yes, I think it’s “milk step.”

Nastya:“Milk”? Why “milk?”

Zhenya:I don’t know why, but…

Nastya:I thought they were giving a massage.

Zhenya:No, it’s something from when they were kittens…

Stefania:Ah, yes. When they suckle…

Zhenya:Yes, yes. I think it’s called “milk step.”

01:35:34

Nastya:But why do they keep doing it [as adults]?

 
Zhenya:Well this…

Stefania:Reflex.

Zhenya:Reflex, yes.

Nastya:That means he wants his mommy, if he does that.

Stefania:No.

Zhenya:He’s in heaven.

Stefania:One minute.

Alik:Go, go.

Nastya:Yes, I was his mommy… I know, Dasha. Epic, epic fail. But I was a cat lady.

Dasha:I still love you.

Nastya:Yes.

01:36:03

Zhenya:Well what, are we choosing?

Alik:[UI], yes?

Dasha:Yes.

Zhenya:Everything the same?

Dasha:Yes, yes.

Zhenya:We’re waiting.

Ryan:Can you select hers?

Nastya:[SL] We still have time, right?

01:36:33

Zhenya:We’ll wait. And what? Why rush?

 
Nastya:I will jump. He already wants to run away probably. And who did she have? //Zhenya?

Dasha://She has structure.

Ryan:Mhm. And Zhenya.

Nastya:Structural geologist, right?... And who is still left?

Alik:That’s it. We’re ready.

Dasha:Zhenya, did you pick?

Zhenya:Yes. I’m all done.

Nastya://[UI]

Ryan://[UI]

Zhenya:Ah, are we done already? Let’s go? I just took…

01:37:02

-

01:37:20

Dasha:Stefania asked us to wait. Yes, we all agreed.

Zhenya:No need to stress her out.

Dasha://Tell them we are [UI]

Alik://She asked us to wait for her. //We decided [UI]

Zhenya://[UI]

Alik:When she asked, we said: “Yeah, of course.”

Ryan://[UI]

Dasha://I have a letter there…

Alik:Huh?

 
Dasha:For Nastya.

Alik:Ah,  I didn’t do Nastya.

Dasha:For Nastya.

Alik:Ah, the letter…

01:37:50

Ryan:She only missed a couple of minutes.

Alik :It’s ok. We can [UI]

Nastya:She will be very glad. She will be super exited…  I’m like a DJ.

Zhenya:Spin that vinyl.

01:38:20

-

01:38:47

Stefania:Did you do everything for me already? Thanks.

Nastya:You’re not offended?

Stefania:No – on the contrary. I am very grateful to you.

Alik:Nothing came. Don’t worry.

Dasha:We just sat here for two minutes.

Zhenya:And they are also waiting.

Stefania:For someone.

Alik:Max.

Zhenya:They are waiting for Max… See? She comes back and there it goes.

Stefania:Mhm.





01:39:22

Zhenya:Waiting for your wattage.

Nastya:[UI]

Stefania:[UI]. Wattage…

Nastya:Yesterday’s word was “thingy?”

Stefania:No.

Ryan:Condyle.

Nastya://Condyle.

Zhenya:// Condyle.

Stefania:There look, good memory.

01:39:55

Stefania:They didn’t answer your letters with anything?

Nastya:No… They don’t know what that word means.

Stefania:They decided not to stir the pot… The less you know the better you sleep.

Nastya:Today you can say it.

Dasha:About condyles?

Nastya:Yes.

Stefania:Every day lets have someone on our team say something about condyles.

Dasha:And to add on to [UI], I also wanted to say that my condyles are okay.

Stefania:Yes.

Dasha:The right one isn’t great, but there [UI].

 
01:40:24

Zhenya:When we have problems with them here, we lubricate them.

Stefania:Today I used…

Nastya:Vaseline.

Stefania:Vaseline for my right condyles.

Dasha:[SL] And the extras.

01:40:48

Nastya:You’re sleeping like this…

Alik:No way. I’m not sleeping… I’m waiting for letters.

Zhenya:Condyles… dudes.

Stefania:Dudes.

Nastya:What? Oh, you have something else.

Dasha:No. I’m just amazed with your…

Alik:What did I do this time?

Dasha:You had one step left. I mean, we went around the circle. You had just one step left, but you took it and sent it around the circle again.

01:41:19

Alik:Seriously?

Dasha:Yes. You sen… well, like…

Alik:I’m hopeless.

Nastya:You’re what?

Alik:Hopeless.

Nastya:Ah.
 
Dasha:Send it to Nastya, please.

Alik:There is nothing. Here, look.

Dasha:Well, I’m sending it to you now… “I don’t have anything”…

Alik:I’m waiting.

Dasha:Mechanical engineer is Stefania.

01:41:52

Alik:There is nothing for her. There is nothing for you all.

Dasha://[UI]

Alik://Ryan, I get like three times this message… This s a team. //Two against one.

Ryan://[UI]

Stefania://He will say he doesn’t know the language.

Ryan:[SL] All this effort.

01:42:20

Nastya:What does two mean? I’m not two against one. I didn’t [UI] anything. I just… this is really funny.

Stefania: I think in next evaluation he pretend that he don’t know… he doesn’t know language. It’s a good way…/It always works.

Alik://[UI]

01:42:50

-

01:43:22

Nastya:What? Again? …Again?

Alik:What did I do? //This time hydrogeologist.

 
Dasha://Anyway, you have biomechanical, right? But why are you sending to Nastya and not to biomechanical?

Alik:[UI]

Dasha:I’m looking at your movements, so you can’t lie.

Alik:There, see? This is not biomechanical.

01:43:56

Alik:If I don’t know, I always send to Nastya. She’s sitting next to me.

Dasha:You still have the second line. Maybe they match… Fine, fine.

Alik:Three more minutes.

Zhenya:Do we still have anything?

Alik:We do, yes. One more D Church, and then…

Dasha:I’m still.

Zhenya:Me, me.

Alik:I’ll tell you after… Yes, one more D Church is left, //and then we turn off the recorders.

Nastya://[UI]

01:44:29

Alik:[UI]…// [UI]

Nastya://Clever.

Alik:And… that means…

Nastya:Again, right? This is already our signature, when…

01:44:59

-

 
01:45:35

Zhenya:A minute and a half and we’re done… And [UI]

Nastya:And freedom.

Zhenya:No way. I’m completely comfortable here. The stools are soft, but that’s still a long time.

Alik:Mhm.

01:46:05

-

01:46:35

-

01:47:05

Nastya:Done, we close?

Alik:Yes, so… D Church nine, please.

Dasha:We close everything here, right?

Alik:Yes.

Stefania:And we keep them on still.

Alik:This – no, yes. We turn off the recorders after D Church. D Church  nine.

Zhenya:And these computers? Can we turn everything off then?

Alik:Well, basically, yes.

Alik:So…

01:47:41

Zhenya:Devil nine. [Reference to a previous joke about how D Church sounds like the Russian word for devil “chort”]

Alik:Mhm.

-

 
01:48:11

01:48:41

-

01:49:11

-

01:49:41

-

01:49:58

Stefania:Dasha, who did you have?

Dasha:Maintenance.

-

01:50:14

Zhenya:Nine only, that’s it?

Alik:Nine, yes.

Stefania:And you, Nastya?

Nastya:…hydrogeologist.

Stefania:Hm?

Nastya:Hydrogeologist

Stefania:Done.

Nastya:How should I know?


 
01:50:50

Stefania:Alik, what about you?

Alik:I have biomechanical.

Stefania:Mhm, I see.

-

01:15:26

Nastya:Can I?

Alik:Yes, you can turn it off now.

Nastya:Thank you guys for wonderful time.

Zhenya:[UI]

Alik:Come back.
