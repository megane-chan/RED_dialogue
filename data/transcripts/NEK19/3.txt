Nastya: Ninety and slash or?

Ryan to Zhenya:And then just your number. So [UI]

Natasha:No…

Zhenya:[UI]

Alik:You have a password.

Nastya:What password?

Ryan:Sirius capital “S,” lower case the rest in “Sirius” and then one nine at [@ sign]

Nastya:Ah, the “at sign.”

Ryan:Mhm.

00:30

Ryan:At your number. Which is three and six.

Nastya:No…

 
Dasha:You don’t get very many attempts to log in. Before [SL] it shuts down.

Natasha to Ryan:Can you do it?

Zhenya:Oh, was that possible?

Dasha:How?

Zhenya:We get several tries.

Dasha://[UI]

Alik://[UI]… //I tried.

Zhenya://[UI]

Natasha://[UI]

Zhenya:Well, it’s still not going to make it.

01:01

Nastya to Alik:[UI]

Alik to Nastya://Yes, I don’t remember what.

Natasha to Ryan://Oh, thank you.

Ryan://So, crew dash two. Capital “S”…

Nastya://Well what, did you find it? …No?

01:29

Alik:So crew dash number and then what?

Ryan:Capital “S” – Sirius.

Dasha:[UI]

Ryan:One nine.

Alik:Yes.

 
Ryan:At.

Alik:Mhm.

Ryan:[UI]

Alik:That’s it?

Ryan:Five.

Nastya:Letters all upper or //lower case?

Ryan://Lower case.

Natasha:Lower case and upper case.

Alik:Lower case.

Zhenya:What do you need?

Natasha:A small spoon… And I didn’t get a cup. Thank you.

Alik:So, let’s turn on the recorder and begin the process.

Dasha:Are we going to watch the whole video again [UI]? …The video again? Yes, we’re going to rewatch it?

Alik:Yes.

Zhenya:That’s fine, do nothing and watch a video.

Alik:At first, yes. The video is //fourteen minutes…

02:30

Zhenya://That’s pretty good.

Dasha:The clock is ticking…

Zhenya:The soldier sleeps away his service.

Natasha:Ready to turn on.

 
Alik:Everyone ready?

Natasha:Yes.

Alik:One, two, three.

Zhenya:Okay.

Alik:Now we need to open Project Red, Training, Training videos… Project Red, Training, Training videos…

03:01

Zhenya:Training… Training videos

Alik:Mhm… And play. Only one computer will have sound, and we’ll all// listen to it.

Natasha://Can we listen to it all with headphones?

Dasha:Yes, let’s do headphones.

Alik:You want to use headphones? //Well, go ahead, as you like.

Natasha://Well, of course…

Dasha://Which video?

Alik:The first one: Design overview.

Zhenya:Excellent.

Alik:We’ve seen this three times now.

Alik:[UI]… [UI]?

Ryan:No

Alik:So, everyone ready?

Ryan:May I ask if you could brag one of those binders [UI]

23:55

Alik:That’s right, yeah… one second… We need them all. Don’t we?

Ryan:Yes, we do. [UI]

Zhenya:[UI]

24:23

Alik:And this is for Dasha.

Zhenya:Thanks.

Alik:This is me.

Zhenya:Ah, meteorologist.  Meteorologist.

Alik:This is you, Zhenya – terrain.

Zhenya:Terrain – yes.

Alik:This is Nastya… Mechanical, ah, this is you. Sorry.

Natasha:I’m still on your crew.

24:52

Alik:So, next we go to the folder where it says, “Crew Data.”

Zhenya:Crew Data. //So, we leave here again?

Alik://Then Project Red… It’s on your desktop “Crew Data.”

Zhenya:Ah, so we just minimize this, right?

 
Alik:Yes, you can just minimize. Crew Data, Project Red… MD forty-three.

Nastya:Wait, please.

Alik:MD forty-three.

Zhenya:Oh, something happened here.

25:24

Alik://Yes, you can stop.

Natasha://Is that old?

Alik:It’s new. It’s today. I mean, for today.

Nastya- MD forty-three?

Alik:Now we listen to our friends. Yes… Oh! Maxwell is first.

Zhenya:[SL] We’re family.

Nastya:I’m already //overheating.

Ryan:No.

Alik:Everyone ready? So, in the same exact folder we click on “Project Red Design.” Right where “Project Red Design” was. We go to the website in the folder… in the white folder everyone has a login like last time.

 
31:22

Dasha:This really long password?

Alik:Yes, everyone should just write that down in notepad.

Dasha:Or open the presentation and copy paste.

Alik:Yes.

31:57

Zhenya:So, this big one, right?

Dasha:Mhm.

32:29

Dasha:I hope our girl came today.

Natasha:Can we just take a photo next time of the password and username? We basically never use this folder. Only when we log in.

Alik:I’m saying I saved it in notepad and now I can copy and paste it. I left it on the desktop, that’s it. Copy Paste and you don’t have to type it again.

Natasha:Well done. Remind me to do that as well.

Alik:Okay.

Zhenya:Seventy-three…

32:59

Zhenya:Ah, I also need… quotation marks. Where are the quotation marks?

Alik:Ryan, can you hep him with the notepad? That way he will just save it to the desktop.

Ryan:Yeah.

Alik to Zhenya:Zhenya, he’ll just type it for you, so that file is always on your desktop. You can just copy it.

Zhenya:Wonderful.

 
Ryan to Zhenya:May I?

Zhenya:Yes. Yes.

Alik to Dasha:Dasha, you logged in already?

Dasha:A long time ago.

Alik:Mhm okay.

33:31

Alik:Well, actually you could write it too. We all have a five-minute delay.

Natasha:Already… Did Nastya write that? To the Engineer?

Ryan to Zhenya:[UI]

Zhenya://So, do we need to write something yet?

Natasha:Apparently, we have a delay between each other as well, because //I don’t see the messages.

Alik://So, look. We have forty-five minutes to complete the assignment, just like last time…So…Most importantly, right now we need to establish contact. Just write //“Hi” to them.

34:02

Natasha:I see three messages from Dasha.

Alik://That’s good.

Dasha://I also see messages but they’re identical.

Natasha:Yes.

Dasha:I see //my messages in another chat.

Alik://Sometimes you just chat with someone [SL] whatever you want to so they can answer.

Dasha://So rotten…

Natasha://[UI]

 
34:36

Alik:So, how is today different from last time? We just have a new point. There it is. [SL]Plantation or what is it? [SL] Plantation nineteen forty-eight.

Natasha://Nineteen forty-eight?

Alik://Nineteen forty-eight. It’s a new place and there are eight of them. So, I assume we will just be looking at all those places, right? Today we’re looking at this nineteen forty-eight.

Natasha:They said it has the biggest water deposits, but it’s polluted. //Do I understand that right? //Nitrate…

Alik://It’s very dirty there. //Lots of dust. Yes.

Natasha:Lots of many things…

35:06

Alik:So the water will be very dirty, it’s difficult to work there, and there are lots of craters… So, it’s not a great place. //[UI]

Zhenya://So we just enter them in, right?

Natasha:Mhm.

Zhenya:Nineteen?

Alik:Nineteen forty-eight.

35:34

Natasha:There is very tough //soil.

Dasha://Forty-eight.

Zhenya:I wrote a lot today.

Alik:Lots of what?

Zhenya:I wrote a lot.

Dasha:Where? In all the chats?

 
Zhenya:Well, in the chat.

Alik:He wrote to everyone.

Nastya://[UI]

Ryan://Hello.

Alik to Nastya:Nineteen forty-eight – that’s our square today.

36:10

Natasha:[SL] You can get to work.

Alik:Yes. You don’t have to wait for their answer. We can establish some numbers there ourselves.

Natasha:Me. //Nothing yet.

Alik://I see… There is a connection.

Natasha:Is that between you all?

Alik:Yes, we’re sitting right here.

40:49

Dasha:Did you take something?

Natasha:Mhm.
41:16

Natasha to Dasha:I did… I’m just telling you what is written here. Wattage is four hundred thousand.

Dasha:Four hundred thousand?

Natasha:Yes, watts. Torque is forty on ninety thousand and [UI]

Dasha:Both, right?

Natasha:Mhm.

41:43

Dasha:As far as I see, our lady has filter A and that’s it. And we only need…

Natasha:Like last time [SL] how many minutes?

42:13

42:46

 
Dasha:Do I understand correctly the higher [UI] the better? … [UI]?

Alik:Yes.

Zhenya:Well, not for the address…

Alik:[UI]

Ryan:[UI]

Nastya:Did you write that?

Alik:I didn’t write anything. Dasha was asking that.

Nastya:No, at the first [UI]

Alik:Yes. But did it make it to you?

Nastya:Mhm, just now.

Alik:Good.

43:18

Natasha:And [SL] Pipe restriction is where?

Dasha:For me it’s on the very first line.

43:44

Dasha:Don’t see it?

Natasha:No.

44:15

-

44:49

Dasha:Mhm… I’ll change it…

Natasha to Dasha:How are you writing it?

Dasha:I have forty now.

Natasha:Nothing yet… But you changed something, right?

 
45:20

Nastya to Alik:You still haven’t entered anything, right?

Alik:Me?

Nastya:Yes.

Alik:Why? I did.

Nastya:You did?

Alik:Yes. All my data.

Zhenya:Save with this checkmark, right?

Alik to Nastya:Yes, I already entered them. You don’t see them?

Nastya:I don’t see them.

Dasha:Ahh, done.

Zhenya:What do we need here?

45:48

Alik:Select or don’t select. And then hit submit.

Nastya to Dasha:You’re fluid, right?

Dasha:Mhm… Writing horrible things about me again, eh?

Nastya:Mhm.

Dasha:I can keep going.

Nastya:You’ll show your integrity, what you write to a child about [UI].

Dasha:Well, yeah.

46:18

Nastya:[UI]

 
Dasha:Just if you have nothing to cover yourself from the rain…

Nastya:Mhm… I have a problem.

Dasha:A very big problem.

Nastya:Again?

46:44

Dasha:I’m changing to thirty.

Alik:Nastya, //you can see mine here, no?

Dasha://[UI]

Nastya://No.

Alik:Strange…

Nastya:But can you see mine?

Alik:No.

Dasha:I see yours… in the chat between you two.

Alik:Something is wrong.

Nastya:[UI]

Zhenya:Okay, I typed something in here. //[UI]

Ryan://[UI]

47:18

Dasha:So, E thirty.

Natasha:Yes, I’m changing watts and torque for now.

Dasha:I don’t understand. [SL] Something is still broken.

Ryan:[UI]

 
Natasha://[UI]

Alik://[UI]

47:45

Ryan:I chose…

Zhenya:You chose?

Ryan:Yes, this one…

Zhenya:Mhm. [SL] Now you need to enter your own… One as well?

Ryan:Yes. One, one and then //checkmark.

Nastya to Alik://What did you do? //Ah, just that?

Alik:Yes, [UI]

Nastya:Yes, but why?

Alik:Just…

Nastya:Then do it …for me too… Can you do mine now?

Alik:…

Ryan to Zhenya:And then… above…

Alik:Yours…//This is mine…

Nastya://Well yes, but mine… I also took. //Here it is.

Ryan://[UI]

48:20

Natasha:Dasha, does yours work?

Dasha://[UI]

Ryan://[UI]


 
Alik to Nastya://[UI]

Natasha://Well, if needed, enter watts at five hundred thousand…

Alik://here someone wrote…

Dasha://[UI]

Ryan to Zhenya://Options…

Natasha:And circulations…

Ryan to Zhenya:And maybe checkmark…

Dasha://[UI]

Ryan:Yes.

Nastya to Alik:[UI]

Ryan:Click the checkmark and see if…

Alik:But who is hydrogeologist?

Nastya:That girl is…

Alik:Ah, yeah… [UI]

Ryan to Zhenya:Yes…

48:54

Nastya:And so… these two here need to sign off. Because I can’t see them. [UI]

Dasha:They’re such dorks…

Zhenya:[UI]

Dasha:Yes, and you in particular.

Alik:Me? //I’m not on your team.

Dasha:Yes. //I asked you: [SL] Pipe restrictions – the more the better? You said: Yes. I thought I did that, and it turns out I didn’t. The more, the [UI]

 
restrictions… So, we’re changing it all back. Everything over again. [To Ryan] It’s not working for me… Not working.

49:25

Natasha:[UI]

Alik:Ah, now I see, Nastya.

Nastya:Yes? //[UI]

Ryan:[UI]

Alik:Maybe it works, but not where we are… We only understood that the fourth time…//Fine, now I’ll show you…

Natasha://[UI]

Nastya:Okay.

Alik:Just a second.

Nastya:I can see you entering there [UI] A.

Alik:Yeah…//Well, then…

Dasha to Ryan://Everything is working.

Alik:Then it was all in vain…

49:48

Dasha:[UI]

Ryan:Hmm. Refresh maybe.

Nastya:Oh, great. We now have… Nine thousand //for population.

Dasha://Yours and mine…

Alik:Oh, that’s good…

Nastya:Yes, we’re finally not in the negatives.

 
Alik:That’s it… win.

Nastya:It’s good. I mean we have not much. It’s nine thousand – not minus like// last time. //[UI]population.

Alik://That’s it, Zhenya, people aren’t dying…

Zhenya://Yeah? //Thank God. //What do we need to do?

Ryan://But we have [UI]?

Dasha://[UI]

Alik://Over there where Sign off is…

50:28

Ryan://[UI]

Alik://You see sign off?

Zhenya://Yes.

Ryan to Nastya://[UI]

Alik://And right under Sign off you see the number of people. How many people.

Zhenya:Well, I see nine.

Dasha://[UI]

Alik://There. Nine thousand three hundred ninety-one, right?

Zhenya:Mhm.

Alik:There. So, that’s how many people //we can supply with water.

Natasha://[SL] Cooper we’re leaving forty, right?

Dasha://Right now. So, I reloaded everything and //[UI]

Zhenya://Totally awesome. //What do you need there? //Checkmark and…

Alik:[SL] You need to reward the others as well. //If you’re ready, you can already…
 
Zhenya:I was ready from the beginning.

50:57

Alik:So did you already //answer yours?

Nastya://Did you already sign off?

Zhenya:No, I’m not answering… They already know [UI]

Alik:Okay, I’m activating Sign off now too…

Nastya:Ok, me too.

Alik:Nastya and I are ready.

Zhenya:Well, place the checkmark?

Dasha:No.

Nastya:Alik and I placed ours already.

Alik:Dasha isn’t ready yet.

51:27

Zhenya:So now them and us.

Nastya:Well, we clicked already.

Alik:And meteorologist… Ryan already placed one.

Zhenya:Well, yeah.

Ryan:I placed one.

Zhenya:You’re falling behind.

Dasha:And [SL] CBC fifty was there initially?

Natasha://[UI]…ah, [SL] CBC?

Dasha:No, [SL]CBC fifty… Tell me, please, five hundred thousand eight hundred… eighty thousand is correct for watts, right?

 
Natasha:Yes… [UI]

Dasha:Anyway, what’s here? Nothing?

51:56

Natasha:Your numbers don’t increase my output somehow. Only my numbers increase my output.

Dasha:Yes, yes, yes.

Ryan:Pumps work…

Natasha:Yes. Torque… So, here we also have [UI] since they also placed checkmarks, entering more won’t work.

Dasha://Eighteen.

Ryan://Eghteen… [UI] [SL] no, no, no… pipe materials.//CBC

Dasha:[SL] CC.

Ryan:Which one?

52:27

Dasha:Five fifty… but, [UI] //[SL] eighty thousand.

52:55

Alik:So, they didn’t answer you, right Nastya? Your question… Very good.

Nastya:They’re probably afraid [UI]

Dasha:[UI]

Alik:Nastya said they are scared to answer.

Dasha:[SL] Why do we need these Chicagoans?

Zhenya://[UI]

Alik:No answers about… She answered me.//[UI]

 
Natasha://[UI]

53:29

Dasha:Ah Chicago – no.

Alik:Can Chicago hear anything?

Dasha:So why didn’t [SL] Zarya log on? We already logged on.

Nastya://I do but hydrogeologist [SL] is not answering.

Ryan:Maybe they are not even on.

Alik:No, they are on. They answered.

Ryan://Oh, they did? Ok.

Natasha://It worked. I see that checkmark.

Dasha://Did you eat a walnut?

Alik://[UI]

Nastya:No.

Dasha:It’s like having soap in your mouth.

Nastya://There is soap in the walnut.

Zhenya://Walnuts with soap are also delicious.

Dasha:What kind again?

Zhenya:They just washed it but forgot to rinse.

Nastya:[UI]

Dasha:Ah, I get it now. Yes.

53:57

Alik:She ate a walnut. She said it tasted like soap in her mouth. And she is like: “Yeah. It’s just a soap in your walnut” [UI]. //It’s fine, right? Like that.

 
Ryan:[UI]

Zhenya:No worries.

Alik:Like that…

Dasha:We’re waiting for six of them, right?

Alik:We already did everything. We can wait.

Nastya:They just have [UI]

Alik:Yes.

Zhenya:Well, of course //we already finished.

Alik://[UI]

Natasha:Oh, I got hungry suddenly.

Zhenya:Of course. You’re working hard.

54:26

Dasha:And, anyway, that’s why… none of them never did anything in the past.

Nastya:I think they just didn’t turn it on.//Our office is also relaxing now.

Alik to Dasha://[UI]

Natasha:Mechanical is me.

Dasha:Terrain specialist  is also ours. Meteorologist is ours too. //[UI

Nastya to Alik://We need to connect with them somehow, maybe then they’ll…

Alik:Well, they’re writing to us. She even answered one of them…

Nastya:We have one – hydrogeologist. She’s alive.

Natasha:She just doesn’t have time to answer for everyone.

54:58

 
Dasha:She’s like our Duma with those buttons, right?

Natasha:On all the rows, right?

Dasha:Drilling wrote something there… Drilling is yours?

Nastya://Yes.

Alik://Yes. It’s Valeria.

Dasha:And ours is totally lost.

55:26

Alik:They’re drinking tea.

Zhenya:Building…

Dasha:Maybe [UI]

Zhenya:While [UI]… while [UI] . I wonder– should we play this again?

Alik:We still need to //send letters.

Natasha://Letters.

Zhenya:But we won’t be in this then?

Alik:Well, it’s ending now. Forty-five minutes… There… then we need to do one questionnaire and then send out letters.

56:02

Zhenya:They’re not cancelling the questionnaire?

Alik:[UI]? … no.

Zhenya:[UI]

Dasha:Dang, really… bitter.

Zhenya:Want another one?

Dasha:I don’t want another one.

 
Alik:Nastya, they aren’t writing you, are they?

Nastya:No.

Zhenya:I don’t know. For the second time, they didn’t send me the time. They used to at least tell me.

Alik to Nastya://But can you see me?

Nastya to Alik:Are you doing something now?

Alik:I wrote, yes.

56:33

Nastya:Just a sec. I’m answering…

Zhenya:I tried so hard. “Hello” I wrote.

Natasha:All for nothing…

Zhenya:I studied.

Alik:Twice the number of letters as last time.

Dasha:We have such a cool chat with each other. How did I end up on a robot team anyway? [UI]

Alik:[UI]

57:03

Dasha:Get out the herring and potatoes… I’m hungry.

Natasha:With pleasure.

Dasha:To [UI] I also agree.

Alik to Nastya:And you?

Nastya:Well, see – zero?

Alik:Ryan, did you get any messages?

Ryan://No, I don’t have.

 
Zhenya://Did it work?

Alik:Look: when they don’t do anything, we have good results- nine thousand people.

Natasha:Yes.

57:30

Alik:No. I’m not saying anything. That’s just //how it is.

Dasha://Statistics.

Zhenya:We’re doing it.

Natasha:We’re just sitting, watching, and doing nothing.

Zhenya:No, they’re probably reporting on paper: “Haven’t you even learned a couple words to answer with?”

Dasha:[UI]

Zhenya:While sitting and reading…

Alik://But Nastya, on the contrary, wrote that she liked their video.

Dasha://I didn’t offend anyone…

Nastya://[UI]

Alik:She wrote to them…

Zhenya:Nastya?

Alik:Yes.

58:00

Zhenya:It’s a good video. Some funny people in it. That Max is a good guy.

Alik:Our guy.

Zhenya:Yes… I feel like he eats well. Very good.

 
Nastya:Will they translate us? All these conversations?

Zhenya:And what? We’re not saying anything wrong. Max is great.

Nastya:Oh, Max answered “I think so.” That’s what he said.

Zhenya:Did he answer you from last time?

Nastya:Yes.

Zhenya:Did it get there?

58:31

Alik:In three weeks…

Nastya:No “Hi” or anything. Where are his manners?

Zhenya:Sneeze on him…

Nastya:Amazing. And that hydrogeologist also didn’t say “Hi.” Alik and I are trying here…

Alik:Yes. We’re being nice.

Ryan:Fluid engineer?

Alik:That’s Dasha.

Natasha:Mhm.

Dasha to Ryan:Are you using smilies?

Nastya to Alik:It’s fine, right?

Alik:I mean you don’t need to try. I even asked there…

58:59

Zhenya:I told you from the very beginning, that all you need to write is “OK’ and that’s it… Oh, something came.

Alik:Oh!

Zhenya:Fluid engineer.

 
Alik:It came from here…

Zhenya:Ryan, where are you?

Alik:Soapy walnut is writing…

Nastya:That’s a new nickname.

Natasha:[UI]

Nastya to Ryan:He called Dasha Soapy Walnut. It’s a new nickname.

59:34

Zhenya:I didn’t get it right away. She says: “I ate soap.” And I said: “How did you eat soap?” A walnut like soap.

Nastya:You are [UI] and she is soapy walnut.

Ryan:[UI]

Nastya:We need four more.

Zhenya:Well, how about this – Kimberly…//So, what area we doing?...// [UI] not answering, right?

Alik://I don’t like all this for some reason. What the hell?

01:00:04

Nastya:Write that to them.

Alik:No, no need for that. They’ll get more offended. //Then they won’t talk to us at all.

Nastya://What about us? Aren’t we offended?

Zhenya:Can we make a decision ourselves here or do we //need to wait?

Dasha://Not for them.

Alik:Well, they need to place checkmarks… and forty-five minutes and that’s it.

Zhenya:Well, I think this //[UI]

Dasha:How much has gone by? Are you keeping track of time?

 
Zhenya:They stopped, I said, //a second time…

Alik://Well, when…

Dasha:So how much? Fifty-seven minutes? Well, there was also the video in there, right? Fifteen minutes, // Ten minutes…

Alik:Well, these windows appear every ten minutes. Ten minutes, twenty minutes, thirty minutes. We’ve seen them twice now. Right?

Dasha://Twenty minutes went by?

Nastya://[UI]

01:00:34

Alik:Next time it will be thirty minutes.

Dasha:My God! We are such a  good team! Priceless. We saved almost nine thousand people.

Zhenya:I don’t know about saved, but at least…

Dasha:Watered…

Zhenya:[UI]

Ryan:What did he say?

Zhenya://[UI]

Alik://We saved nine thousand people all by ourselves.

01:01:05

Natasha:[UI] [SL] humor.

Ryan:[UI]

Alik:[UI]

Nastya:No. [UI]


 
Zhenya:They depend.

Alik:On us.

Ryan:They depend on us?

Zhenya:Yes. On us.

Ryan:The time is ticking.

Natasha:Time is ticking?

Alik:Time is ticking.

01:01:34

Natasha:[UI]. “Ticking” is “ticking”?

Zhenya:Yes, [UI]

Alik:Correct…

Natasha:Time is ticking.

Nastya:Can I go to the bathroom?

Alik:Of course.

Natasha:There may be some messages…

Nastya -Yes, in any case.

Dasha:Then they’ll say: “Guys, [UI]”

All://[UI]

01:02:07

Dasha:Well, [UI]

Alik://Same people…

Dasha://Now they’ll send someone… They could at least wave a camera. Any movement…

 
Zhenya:They won’t wave, they’ll go like this…

Dasha:It will be like Morse Code, right?

Zhenya:Yes.

Natasha:We should have arranged with them long ago so they could give some signs.

Dasha://Yes, everything is fine, no.

Natasha://[UI]

Zhenya:Well, yesterday they told Ryan to help. When the time came, //everyone was gone. Nine five.

Alik://[UI]

01:02:38

Alik:Aslan said we need to help [UI]

Ryan:Yes.

Alik:So this is the perfect opportunity right there.

Zhenya:So, Ryan, ask me to help out right now. If needed, we can translate.

Alik:Ask for help and Zhenya will help out.

Ryan:I will get more people.

Natasha:Alik, today we’re eating cucumber. Remember?

Alik:Yes. I already told Nastya that twice… Not just cucumbers… what else?

01:03:08

Ryan://Cucumber.

Alik://Cake [UI]

Zhenya:Cucumber.

 
Natasha:Pinckles.

Alik:Pickles.

Natasha:Not pinkles, pickles.

Alik://[UI]

Nastya://Max is wishing us happy May first. He got his hair cut:what a stud. [UI]

Zhenya:Did he really cut his hair?

Dasha:I need to cut your hair. I have experience already.

Nastya:You don’t listen to them, do you? I think I’ll be ready for that soon.

01:03:40

Dasha:Shower soon, so I’ll have experience cutting with head hair, but also [SL] chest.

Natasha:[UI]

Nastya:Chest?

Dasha:Yes.

Nastya:You’re going to cut chest hair?

Dasha:Well, not cut it, but do [UI]

Nastya://[UI]

Natasha:I don’t think Nastya understood what Dasha meant, at first… No one would.

Nastya:Yes. //They can hear us…

Dasha://In [UI] it’s called shaving a lightning bolt around the neck and temples. But, here it will be on the chest.

01:04:15

Nastya:Good luck… On whom?

 
Alik:So, now we have Project Red… and we are not working at all.

Nastya:You responded that… Ah, so I didn’t get this message from you: “Everything is in order.”

Alik:Why? There shouldn’t be delays here.

Nastya:I don’t see it.

Dasha:Zhenya, did you eat any walnuts?

Zhenya:No. I tried them a while ago and for some reason they taste like cellar potatoes to me.

01:04:45

Dasha:They were good. Just now, for some reason…

Nastya:They got old.

Zhenya:I’m telling you, they started washing them… with soap… or they didn’t rinse them… Now I will introduce myself for the presentation as [UI] a cosmonaut – Terrain specialist… or who am I again?

01:05:17

Zhenya:Correct – Terrain. I like drilling more.

Alik:Drilling?

Zhenya:Yes. Somehow it sounds better… Drilling.

Alik:That is about drilling.

Zhenya:It just works better – drilling.

Nastya:For drilling, yeah. Good translation.

Alik:[UI], yeah?

01:05:51

Zhenya:This one isn’t bad either – Scientologist.

 
Natasha:Scientologist.

Zhenya:Sedimentologist.

Nastya:Oh, work!

Alik:That means thirty minutes.

Zhenya:So, only a bit left, right?

Alik:Well, really, there is another fifteen minutes after that.

Dasha:So half of what we already did.

Zhenya:Half?

Dasha:Mhm.

01:06:21

Zhenya:No, I mean with this right here.

Alik:Yes, that thing appears every ten minutes.

Zhenya://And then:letters… //letters are coming to us.

Dasha:For fifteen more minutes.

Natasha:We need to sit for forty-five minutes with this Project Red. Watch over this program.

Zhenya:I feel like we’ve already been sitting here for forty-five hours.

Natasha:It’s actually only been thirty minutes. Fifteen left.

Zhenya:I feel like they’re lying for some reason.

Natasha:If none of them move their program ends there. They told us to finish everything in forty-five minutes.

01:06:58

Natasha:I lost something [UI]
 
Zhenya:They’re sleeping.

Natasha:There really is no one there.

Zhenya:Max is the only one who came in. He stopped on his morning run and to hit the plus sign.

Alik:[UI]

01:07:34

Dasha:Oh! The mechanic woke up.

Natasha:Yeah, right.

Dasha:See the message?

Natasha:[SL] They send this message? We have twenty minutes… Maybe they’re sitting in [UI]?

Zhenya:What?

Natasha:Well, like, they stayed in the program so it would send some know-nothing message in the chat every ten minutes.

Dasha:Yes, definitely, because…

01:08:02

Natasha:Because: “They send this message. We have twenty minutes” …//Is meaningless.

Alik://Yes. They’re checking something.

Natasha:Just as if…

Nastya:Ah there, I received one from you.

Alik:You received one? Good.

Nastya:I can’t see it.

01:08:27

Zhenya:This year, in just a few months basically, I will change my passport… and I’m doing this nonsense… I’m playing toys with kids.

 
Natasha:You’re doing this as charity. Charity.

Zhenya:Yes, altruism… It’s good Ryan is here and helping.

Alik:He is thankful he is next to Ryan.// [UI]

Ryan://[UI]

Zhenya:[SL] Didn’t get lost.

01:09:03

Ryan:That means that he is in charge of the check.

Zhenya:No, I’m just reacting to my title – Terrain.

Alik:Ha! Good.

Zhenya:Well, did they send it?

Alik:-Nastya is writing to me here.

Nastya:[UI]

01:09:52

Dasha:Write something to me. [UI]

Zhenya:But who are you?

Dasha:I’m fluid engineer.

Zhenya://[UI]

Alik to Ryan://Email her.

Natasha://[UI]

Dasha://[UI] a heart comes out.

Zhenya:How do you write it? Do I click on you or write it?

Dasha:Yes. “Hi, how do you do?”

 
01:10:28

Dasha:Now you’re all writing to me and I will //send out the letters in the next program.

Zhenya://And he’ll send you the answer at the next session in three weeks.

Nastya:You’re writing in Russian in the general chat.

Alik:What?

Nastya:You wrote something in Russian in the general chat.

Alik:No, only to you.

Nastya:No, in the general geologist chat.

Alik:No.

Nastya:“I don’t know what to write, so I’ll write this crap. [UI]”

Zhenya:Don’t worry about it.

Alik:I only wanted to write that to you.

01:10:59

Zhenya:Today is May first… They’ll get it.


01:11:02

Ryan:What did you write, Alik?

Nastya://He wrote in Russian.

Alik://I wrote in Russian, but I thought it was for [UI]

Nastya:He wrote: “I don’t know what to write so I’ll write this bullshit here.”

Ryan:You can’t expect them to be reading all of them anyways.

Alik:Yeah, that’s… anything //[UI]

Nastya:Wait, I also… What I wrote to you loaded in general chat on mine for some reason.

Alik:Yeah, exactly. Not all the windows here //go…

01:11:32

Nastya://Know what I wrote?

Natasha://Yes.






Alik:That’s it, write carefully… //Because they writing to them…

Dasha://Only mine is wrong for some reason…

Nastya:Ok. My message to Dasha //also was [UI]

Alik://She is operations.

Dasha:Yes, but it came to me for some reason not like from the sedimentologist, and not from you.

Alik:Already, see, three times…

01:11:49

[Video and audio do not match]

01:14:16

[Audio from 00:23:24 of this video]

01:24:43 [Audio and video match again]

Zhenya:Everything works for everyone. Yes.

Alik:What, done already?

Zhenya:Yes… I’m terrain

01:25:13

01:25:43

01:26:13

01:26:48

Natasha:[UI] they don’t choose very well… I don’t know… all my work with the Martian groups.

Zhenya:You’re hard on them…

Natasha:Not as hard as I could be yet, but now I’m choosing “somewhat [UI]” //instead of “nice [UI]”

Dasha://Can we check with our [UI] about what role the Martian group plays besides placing checkmarks? Well, if robots are answering us, in our version, since it’s not always…

01:27:25

Alik:You think they aren’t people?

Dasha:Well, we’re just talking about some of our data, and the person there writes about twenty minutes.

Alik:Well, today was an unusual session…

Natasha:All the other times //were like that.

Dasha://Well, last time too, when the delays started, there wasn’t a single decent, appropriate answer. I mean, at first they praised us: “Yes, together is cool. Good job for choosing her…” There weren’t delays then. The messages were live…

01:27:56

Alik:Well, we can ask. [To Ryan] She wants to [UI] if it’s actually people responding to us and they do not use a computer program. [UI] since delay has been implemented, the system really [UI] the communications.

Ryan:Yeah. [UI] people. But I don’t know.

Zhenya:Does this actually bother someone?

Dasha:No. Well, it’s just that we have to sit like this for another twenty minutes…

01:28:26

Zhenya:Well, [UI].

 
Dasha:And?

Zhenya:[UI] anybody.

Dasha:We’ll finish all this and break up…

Zhenya:They will sit there…

Dasha:On purpose?

Zhenya:Send a photo… //[UI]

Alik://[UI]

01:28:54

Alik:How old are you?

Zhenya:Yes. How old are you?

Ryan:Everybody [UI]

Alik:Yeah. Let everybody [UI].

Natasha:And why did geology ask that question [UI] ?

Dasha:Yes.

Natasha:In two parts.

Dasha:More parts.

Natasha://For now, only the second one…

Alik:Zhenya finished ten minutes ago now. He’s relaxing.

01:29:31

Alik://Just no nuts…

Natasha://[UI]

Dasha:Yes, [UI]…

Alik to Ryan:Do you know who will bring that [SL] LC two?

 
Ryan:[UI]

Alik:The [SL] PLC for this.

Ryan:It must be here. One of Igor’s…

Alik:Igor?

Ryan:Yeah, I think. //Just email him.

Alik://If it really bothers you, you can ask Igor [SL] Saveliev. But I doubt even he knows about this. [UI] knows more.

01:30:08

Ryan:You would just send it to [UI].

Alik to Dasha:Wait until May eleventh and then ask your questions.

Zhenya:Write them down in a notebook and then ask when he arrives.

Alik://It will be like that.

Ryan:Igor mentioned that the chat would be [UI] delayed. So, I think last time we had [SL] their local [UI].

Alik to Dasha:See, he says Igor said then that as soon as the delay takes effect, this chat will basically be useless. So, then we will work independently from them, and they will be independent from us. And at the end we will place checkmarks and finish and that’s it. Like today. So, waiting for them is pointless.

01:30:53

Ryan:A little different… This went different today.

Natasha:So, we need to do more probably… Don’t place checkmarks in the first ten minutes, but after fifteen or twenty minutes //so that later [UI]

Alik:We managed in seven or eight minutes, right?

Natasha:Well, sure. We can sit and chat. Just don’t place checkmarks.

Alik:We can do that, yes… So, everyone ready? Let’s go the folder Project Red, Training, Training videos //and the very last one.

 
Natasha://Well, we know all this now… Maybe we don’t have to…

01:31:22

Zhenya:All of this is prescribed, right?

Alik:Mhm.

Zhenya:So, we’re doing it. What is it? Training…

Alik:The very last one – Project Red Training [UI].

Natasha:Didn’t you say we could skip it later?

Alik:It’s only four minutes… I’ll see what comes after.

Nastya:Dang… Sorry.

Natasha:As long as you’re whole.

Nastya:Sorry… [SL] Yes, progress.

Natasha:Good packaging.

01:31:53

Ryan:[UI]

Zhenya:Ryan’s pulse skipped even.

Ryan:Hm?

Zhenya:When that fell [talking about the tablet that fell], you’re pulse skipped… Will you survive?

Alik:[UI]

Natasha://[UI]

Ryan://[UI]… Oh, the baby…

Nastya:So good… Nice case.

 
01:32:24

Ryan:Yeah, [UI]

Zhenya:Two times here, right?

Alik://Hm?

Natasha:Yes.

Zhenya:This stuff will be twice?

Dasha://[UI]

Alik://Ten minutes each. So, twenty minutes.

Zhenya:Well, I don’t like it… Well, from what I can see… She’ll like it.

01:33:12

Dasha:[UI]?

Zhenya:Yeah.

01:33:42

-

01:34:12

-

01:34:42

Nastya:Simply beautiful.

01:35:12

-

01:35:37

Dasha to Natasha:Are you sure?

 
Alik://Well, everyone listened already?

Nastya://[UI]

Alik:Well, that’s it. Then go to Crew data…

Nastya:[UI]

Alik:Project Red and we click//[UI]

Nastya:Project Red Relay?

Alik:Yes.

Alik:Project Red Relay.

01:36:09

Dasha:[UI] I wanted to say!

Nastya:What, did you say something in Ukrainian?

Dasha:I just couldn’t hear myself and thought I was being silent.

Zhenya:So, we’re selecting ourselves?

Alik:Yes. Here it’s ourselves…

Natasha:Well, this is the old scheme, yes. Neighbor and…

01:36:36

Nastya:Neighbor and who was second?

Dasha:Well, come on, we have hydrogeologist.

Nastya:And I’m picking structural geologist.

Dasha:Structural geologist. You will have maintenance specialist, I’ll have biomechanical…

Alik:Who do I have?

Nastya://Maintenance.

 
Dasha://No, no, wait. You have sediment geologist…

Alik:Sedimentologist?

Dasha:Yes, //sedimentologist.

Alik to Nastya://And you, right?

Nastya:Yes.

Dasha:I have, well… what’s-it-called. You have biomechanic, and you have drilling.

Natasha:Drilling and meteorologist.

01:37:06

Zhenya:Meteorism… Only drilling…

Dasha:[UI]

Ryan:[UI]

Dasha://You are biomechanic.

Natasha://I have hydrogeologist.

Zhenya:So, so…

Dasha:You have drilling…

Zhenya:And?

Dasha:And biomechanic…oy. //Meteorologist.

Natasha://Meteorologist.

Zhenya:Meteorologist… So, and “Next,” right?

Ryan:Yes.

Natasha:[UI]

Zhenya:Drilling…

 
Dasha:But you already saw, right, Alik?

Alik:What?

Dasha:Materials.

01:37:35

Alik:Yes.

Dasha:[UI]

Nastya:Materials girls.

Alik:Thanks, Nastya.

Nastya:Madonna song.

Zhenya:So we, basically, send the unknowns around the circle, right?

Alik:Someone will send them.

01:38:04

Alik:If we don’t know, just send it on. Someone will take care of it.

Zhenya:[UI]

Ryan:Unless it’s me.

Nastya:No it has specific meaning in //our language.

Natasha:Army humor.

Nastya://Send it on a circle, you know?

Natasha://hashtag.

Nastya:Now you got it?

Ryan:Yeah.

 
01:38:47

Nastya:So like that four times, right?

Ryan:Mhm.

Nastya:Eight locations, //so…

Alik://Eight places [UI]

Nastya:And, it seems we… yes, three. And, also [UI]

01:39:31

Zhenya:[UI]

Natasha:Thrown up.

Alik:[UI]

Ryan:We probably could while we do that.

Alik:Probably.

Dasha:Now a letter is coming [UI] to you. I sent it around the circle.

01:40:01

Nastya:Alik, [SL] are you sleeping?

Alik:Yes.

Dasha:No strength or energy left.

Alik:What’s so funny?

Nastya:Like on the bus – [UI]. No.

Dasha:Who has structure? You?

Nastya:Yes.

 
01:40:44

Nastya:Yes, only [UI] to send…

Zhenya:I don’t know. I think, [UI]. At least Max showed up.

Alik:Poor Max. //Speaking of Max…

Nastya://New word… New word to learn for you. It’s a good one.

Ryan:Say what?

Nastya:New word. Slang.

Ryan:What is it?

Nastya:Tukhlyak

Ryan:Tukhlyak.

Natasha:[UI]

Ryan:The meaning?

Nastya:Two meanings: first one is when something goes old and pretty bad smell…

01:41:15

Alik:It’s rotten.

Nastya:Yeah, and second meaning for slang it’s when it’s boring.

Ryan:Say it again.

Nastya:Tukhlyak.

Ryan:Tukhlyak.

Nastya:Or you can say like me, you know – tukhlyachok.

Ryan:Tukhlyachok.

Dasha to Alik://I just see what was here.

 
Natasha://You can say a “tukhlaya vecherinka.”

Dasha to Alik:I’m sending it, //you see? //[UI]

Ryan://Vecherinka.

Natasha:Tukhlaya vecherinka – it’s //boring party.

Ryan://Boring party.

01:41:45

Alik to Dasha:Are you offended?

Dasha:Well yes, I was hurt that you had something in there.

Alik:I think, if it’s for them, then [UI]

Nastya:Behind the computer!

Natasha:[UI]
