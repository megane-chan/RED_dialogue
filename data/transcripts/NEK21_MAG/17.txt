Transcript

Will: You need to turn yours back On, too. 

Salah:  Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. So, you crossed the…Okay. Today is May 31st, 2022. It’s mission day two hundred and eight. The time is 2:25PM. Three, two, one. //Mark.

All: //Mark.

Salah: Why they are so late? I’m writing to them…

Ashley: It’s really early over there. 

Salah: What?

Ashley: Yeah. It’s like 6AM over there, I think. Isn’t it?

Salah: I don’t know. 

Oleg: Will, can you look at thirty-five forty?

Will: Mhm.

Salah: Every time I notice that we come first and then, // after twenty minutes, they come. 

Oleg: //It’s just a highly advantageous place.

Will: Yep. It’s ok. There is water. 

Oleg: There it is. //It’s not too deep and…

Salah //[UI]

00:00:59:18

Will: Yes.

Ashleу: [UI]

Oleg: Look at thirty-five forty. 

Ashley: Thirty-five forty. Seems average to me. Not bad and not the best, but average. [UI]

Salah: Very good. 

Vika: Not the best. 

Oleg: Hm?

Vika: Not the best but can go.

00:01:58:12

Oleg: Twenty-five thirty-six too.

Ashley: Twenty-five thirty-six. 

Will: There is no water.

Oleg: What?

Will: There is no water.

Oleg: Really?

Salah: Thirty-five twenty-one. 

Ashley: Twenty-one…Oh, no…It’s a no for me. Not for me, dog.

Will: It’s not a lot of water. It’s decent. It’s not as good as the other one, but…

Salah: She is not good for me also.

Ashley: Why did you suggest it then?

Salah: Just to see if it’s okay…Do you see? It’s deep. Thirty-five twenty-one. 

00:03:00:18

Ashley: What is the construction suitability really. Obviously, I can guess what it means, but, like, what is…

Salah: It’s all 0.5. For all of them. 

Ashley: Oh, really?

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: It doesn’t change at all?

Salah: [SL] I don’t know why. 

Ashley: Weird. 

00:04:00:00

-

00:04:26:37

Oleg: Ten forty. Pardon, eleven forty.

Will: Eleven forty? Fine.

Ashley: Eleven forty.

Will: There is no water.

Ashley: Okay. …What about seventeen forty-one?

Will: Seventeen forty-one?

Asley: Mhm.

Will: A 100% water loss. 

Salah: Check sixteen sixteen. 

Will: One second. 

Ashley: Sixteen sixteen. 

Salah: Oops. 

Will: Okay. It looks like they’ve arrived. 

00:05:18:30

Will: Which one?

Salah: Sixteen sixteen. 

Ashley: It’s actually not bad for me. 

Will: No water. 

Ashley: Okay.

Vika: I have a lot of contaminations. 

Oleg: Twenty-one forty-five.

Ashley: Not bad.

Vika: There is no water.

Salah: Forty…

Ashley: Really?

Will: Which was the last?

00:06:00:06

Oleg: Twenty-one forty-five. 

Will: Wait, let me see. May I? ...Twenty-one forty-five. 

Oleg: Do you also see the volumes?

Will: It's a different volume, but I just want to know whether they match. Okay, yeah. Average water loss…yes, okay… Why don’t you check too? Let’s move to the next.... What else left?

00:06:58:44

Vika: Nothing left. 

Will: [SL] Karina, shut up. 

Vika: [SL] People. 

Will: You’re an ass. 

Salah: Twenty-one zero one…I took all your ideas, okay?

Will: Not great, but at least there is water.

Salah: I took your idea. 

Ashley: What about two forty-five? Two forty-five. 

Will: May I? May I? Wait, wait.

Ashley: Yes.

Will: Twenty-one....one.... May I have a look?

Vika: What?

Salah:  I took Ash idea.

Will: Yes. It’s the same. //You are looking at the same thing as I do.

Salah: //Twenty-one zero four.

Vika: Yes.

Will: Why didn’t you ever tell me this?

Oleg: [UI]

Will: Why do you think that I need to check this every time by myself?


00:08:00:29

Vika: I didn’t think so. It’s you who did. 

Will: Did you know?

Salah: [SL] Yes. 

Will: That’s it. You just //found out, didn't you?

Ashley: //It’s not bad.

Vika: I was always checking other metrics. 

Will: Sure.

Oleg: Nine twenty-eight. 

Will: Right…Ash, which one?

Ashley: Two forty-six. Oh, no, sorry. //Two forty-five. 

Vika: //Two forty-five.

Ashley: Sorry. Sorry. Thank you. 

Will: Not enough water. 

Oleg: Nine twenty-eight. 

Will: Wait, I just need...

Ashley: Nine twenty-eight...

Salah: Which one?

Ashley: Nine twenty-eight.

Oleg: Salah, it’s good for you. I know this. 

Salah: Nine twenty-eight.

Will: Which one? Which one?

Oleg: Nine twenty-eight. 

Will: Not bad. Definitely not bad. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

00:09:00:23

Will: It’s a lot of water. 

Ashley: More than the first one?

Will: Oh yeah. Oh, yeah. Significantly more. Almost double. 

Vika: For me it seems good too. 

Oleg: Had they written to anyone, guys?

Vika: No. 

Oleg: There is another good one — five nineteen.

Will: One moment. 

00:10:10:12

Vika: Once again please.

Oleg: Five nineteen. 

Will: There is no water.

Vika: There is no water. 

Oleg: What about three twenty-seven?

00:10:59:37

Will: 100% water loss. 

Ashley: Damn, I wanted to say it's very good. Damn. 

Vika: You say it’s a loss and I’d say it’s a waterfall. 

Will: There is a loss indeed, but it’s something we both have.

Vika: Yes. 

Will: So…

Oleg: And, here's an interesting one — seven thirty-eight. 

Will: 93% water loss.

Salah: Which point is the best one for now?

Will: Right now?

Salah: Yeah.

Vika: Good question.

Will: Nine twenty-eight. 

Vika: Seven thirty-eight: very dirty water. 

00:12:02:36

Oleg: Right. It is mineralized, but it could be cleared quickly with minimal losses. 

Ashley: What about thirteen twenty-five?

Will: One second.

Vika: Fifteen twenty-five?

Ashley: Thirteen.

Vika: Thirteen.

Vika: Ain’t no water. 

Will: That’s it. 

Salah: Deep.

Ashley: Okay.

Oleg: Fourteen thirty-five. 

Ashley: Fourteen thirty-five. I like it. 

Vika: Not bad.

Will: Fourteen thirty-five?

00:13:00:13

Salah: Okay. 

Will: Well it’s okay in terms of water but still....

Oleg: I see it almost clear. 

Ashley: [UI]

Oleg: Nineteen nineteen. 

Vika: One moment. 

Oleg:  Speaking of water quality, it is basically gorgeous if it does present there.

Will: Which one?

00:14:00:14

Oleg: Nineteen nineteen.

Ashley: Not bad. 

Will: There is no water. 

Oleg: But tell me, do you rate somewhere that it is sandy or rocky ...

Vika: There isn’t any. There are only different layers.

Oleg: Because I have //parameters, these are the indicators

Salah:// Did you get a reply?

Ashley: Not yet. 

00:15:00:05

Oleg: well, I am actually [UI] don’t rate anything. And ground temperature. 

Ashley: It’s cold in here. 

Salah: Huh?

Ashley: It’s cold in here today. 

Will:  Uhh, it's five second.

Salah: Cold?

Ashley: I feel cold.

Vika: Let’s eat this one. 

Will: What?

Vika: Pistachio.

Will: We have eaten these. 

Vika: Greedy. 

Will: Don't we have some more over there, do we?

00:16:10:07

Salah: Check thirty-one thirty-one. 

Ashley: Not my favorite.

Vika: Thirty-one thirty-one…Not bad. 

00:17:06:04

Vika: Not bad for me…But I’ll actually clean up.

Ashley: Wow! I got a “Hi, Ashley!”. A specific. 

Vika: That’s your day. 

Ashley: Yes! 

Oleg: What do you mean?

Ashley: But…did they get our video, because they already know that meteorologist here it’s me. 

00:17:59:06

Salah: You’re becoming famous, Ash. You see?

Ashley: One day I’ll be at your rankings of fame. 

Salah: “Good morning! Hello!” when I ask them, see? They are looking at thirty-five forty.

Will: They said that their mechanical engineer didn’t like it, but they just said, “fifteen seven”.

Ashley: What were some of the good ones we had?

Will: Nine twenty-eight was the best one. Fifteen seventeen.

Vika: Wow! 

Ashley: What was the seventeen one? Sorry. 

Will: Fifteen seventeen. 

Ashley: That’s what they suggested?

Will: That one is passable on my end. 

Salah: //It’s deep. It’s deep. 

Ashley: //So they offered fifteen seventeen. It’s not the best.

Salah: Yeah. It’s deep also. It’s not good for me…Who told you about thirty-five forty?

00:19:01:22

Will: We told them about thirty-five forty. Who said that? We did. 

Oleg: Well, in principle, not bad, but it's too deep. Deep…I didn't consider such depths, it seems… Well, then, let’s check twenty-seven eight. Twenty-seven and eight. 

Will: It’s they who said twenty-seven-eight?

Oleg: No, it was me. The fact is that what they mentioned, in principle, is fine, but too deep, and Salah is pretty sure that...

00:20:00:29

Oleg: It’s deep.

Will: Twenty-two thirty-seven. That’s from their side...

Ashley: Twenty-two thirty-seven?

Will: It’s decent in terms of water. 

Vika: Twenty-two //thirty-seven is okay if only Oleg be able to clear it up.

Ashley: //It’s okay. 

Salah: //[SL] It’s an important question, yeah?

Ashley: Of course. Important. 

Salah: Of course. 

Vika: It’s so important. 

Ashley: Twenty-two thirty-seven could pass. It’s about average for me. 

Will: Yeah. Twenty-two thirty-seven is actually very good. 

Oleg: Yes, this is the limit. We may try.

Salah: Which one?

Vika: Twenty-two thirty-seven. 

Ashley: Twenty-two thirty-seven, yeah. 

Salah: Is this suggested by us or by them?

Ashley: By them.

Vika: Yes.

00:21:01:11

Oleg: Well, actually, yes. 

Salah: Twenty-two?

Ashley: Twenty-two thirty-seven.

Oleg: With a 30% water loss. But there is water, right?

Will: Yes, yes. Pretty much. 

Vika: This one is for you. 

Ashley: So, the only point we suggested to them was nine twenty-eight, right? And thirty-five forty. 

Will: Nine twenty-eight, thirty-five forty, and they are suggesting twenty-two thirty-seven, which seems to be functional. 

Ashley: Okay.

Oleg: And here is another part of the same story — forty-seven thirty-one. 

Will: Forty-seven...

Oleg: Yes, I think this one would go. Well exactly....

Ashley: Forty-seven thirty-one?

Oleg: Thirty-one. 

Ashley: Thirty-one.

Will: There’s nothing. 

00:22:07:00

Oleg:  What about thirty-nine twenty-four?

Will: Which one?

Oleg: Thirty-nine twenty-four.

Will: This one will do, but it's no better than others. 

Ashley: Oh, there’s no…It's not at all for me.

Oleg: Fine. Then we remove it. 

Salah: They are telling me nine twenty-eight. 

Ashley: That’s what we suggested to them

Salah: Yeah, we suggested, but…

Will: Yeah, well, let them work. You know, remember there’s a big gap here in time, so, they probably discussed that. That means that they sent that four minutes ago, so…

Salah: [SL] Ok so let’s check this one. 

Oleg: So from what we have, the best thing was what they offered or what we had?

Will: Where there is plenty of water it's ours. 

00:23:00:35

Will: But what is better for everyone — it’s theirs offer. 

Oleg: Twenty-two thirty-seven?

Will: Yes, I think so. 

Oleg: So, okay then… Do you fill out the calculator when you do it?

Will: What?

Oleg: Are you filling out the calculator?

Will: No need. I’ll do it myself. 

00:24:00:25

Ashley: It is automatically filled in [UI].

Oleg: That's why I fill it in. But I'm just looking at others. 

Ashley: And tell me if there is water at fourteen thirty-seven. 

Vika: No. Fourteen thirty-seven?

Ashley: Yes. 

Vika: Uno momento por favor. 

Ashley: De nada. 

Vika: Let’s see. [UI].

Salah: [UI],

Oleg: It’s too dirty.

Vika: And there is not any water. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Vika: Sorry. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Vika:  But we do have an apple. 

Vika: Right…

00:25:22:06

Salah: What? Huh?

Ashley: Nothing. 

Salah: What?

Ashley: I’ll tell you in a second. 

Vika: Interesting. 

Salah: [UI],

Vika: What?

Ashley: [UI].

Vika: Damn! Don't be dumb! 

00:26:00:00

-

00:27:20:40

Ashley: They said that… my team also said that they are looking at //forty forty-five. 

Salah: //[SL] We did, thank you. [UI]

Ashley: What? Oh, about the videos. Because I sent…Oh, you’re not getting mine, are you?

Salah: This is robotics. 

Ashley: Oh, because I said, like, “I hope that you got our videos.” And they said, “We did.” So, they got our videos. Also, I just realized that that’s you…That’s why I was like, “Oh my God!”. That’s what I’m saying. 

00:28:02:08

Salah: I make you happy. 

Ashley: You did! You do! So they said forty forty-five too. That they are looking at it. Have you looked at it?

Oleg: Forty-five?

Ashley: Forty forty-five. 

Vika: Forty forty-five?

Ashley: Yes. 

Salah: Five?

Ashley: I don’t like that one. 

Vika: No. Very much [UI]

Oleg: Oh no.

Ashley: I think nine twenty-eight is the best.

Vika: Forty forty-five is very dirty. The previous one was better.

Oleg://Well that wouldn’t do definitely. 

Ashley: //It is very...definitely no. Too dirty and…

Salah: //Which one are they talking about?

Oleg: There will be a very big loss. 

Will: I don’t know. 

Oleg: I will clean it up, but the loss will be up to 60%. Only while cleaning. And look how much water is there. 

00:28:59:15

Ashley: But we do like nine twenty-eight, right?

Will: Yeah, yeah. 

Ashley: They are asking me if I like that. 

Will: Yeah. 

00:30:14:10

Oleg: What about six twenty-eight?

Will: What are you still searching for? Let me see.

Oleg: Until a decision is made here, what else to do?

Will: There is no water. 

Oleg: Too bad. 

Vika: No water! No water!

Oleg: So what was the decision?

Will: Still waiting.

Oleg: Thirty-five forty? In your variant, where is more water? Twenty-two thirty-seven?

00:30:59:00

Will: Nine twenty-eight, but we're just waiting for them. 

Ashley: Six…

Maybe Salah: [SL] Twenty-eight. [UI] …Third one: “We need video from you, guys?”

Ashley: They already gave us a video. 

Salah: When?

Ashley: They gave us the group video. That’s why we sent one in response. 

Salah: We sent?

Ashley: They sent to us before we sent our video. 

Will: And then they sent one in response. 

Ashley: They sent another one?

Will: Oh, no. 

Salah: No, I’m asking about the response. 

Will: We sent a video; they sent a video. We sent another video. They need to send another one now. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Vika: What?

Ashley: I’m over videos. I don’t want to do any more. 

Will: Yeah, but I want one from them. 

Salah: From them, not from us. 

Ashley: But we already got one from them. 

Vika: //I didn’t get one from them.

 Will: //What about another one?

00:31:58:28

Will: You don’t just write to somebody: “Hello! – Hi, how are you?!” //And then you…you don’t end the conversation at that point. 

Ashley: //But we didn’t ask them. We didn’t ask them any additional questions. 

Salah: We miss them. That’s why we want the video. 

Ashley: Alright, alright. 

Will: This might be the last time we talk to this group. 

Oleg: Have you written to everybody?

Ashley: You mean, here? Yes. I think yes, but no one answers me. Almost nobody.

00:33:00:00

-

00:33:56:06

Will: Thank you ... So, nobody answers? I want some juice...can I have juice?

Vika: No. 

Will: Thank you.

Vika: No. 

Will: Well actually no. 

Vika: The structural geologist appears to be Armenian. 

Will: Really?

Oleg: Why?

Vika: Because he writes in Russian and is in Armenia.

Will: And he says that he was born in Armenia. And he showed us his Instagram, although we told him that we //can't see it, but...

Vika: //We don't have access, yes.

Ashley: Wait! You guys have Instagram and stuff?

Salah: What?

Will: What do you mean?

00:34:59:37

Vika: What?! What?! What?!

Will: What are you talking about?

Ashley: What did you say?

Will: He said…he said…he told us his Instagram, but then we said that we don’t have access to Instagram, but…but his name is W. Ogonyan or something like that, so he was like, “Okay, alright.”

Vika: //Yes, right. 

Will: He is Armenian like literally. 

Ashley: I told them// in my personal video, that we do have to connect with them on social media after the isolation. 

Oleg: //But does he live in the USA?

Vika: //He is now in Armenia.

Will: I mean, we can’t connect with them.

Ashley: After isolation we can. 

Will: We literally are not capable of connecting with them. We can’t do anything on our Instagram. We can’t…

Ashley: What do you mean? After isolation we can.

Will: I know that, but I’m saying that we are in isolation, and we can’t do it because we don’t have social media.

Ashley: He’s probably giving it to you so you can do it later! 

Will: Yeah, that’s exactly why, but it doesn’t…

Ashley: I know that we don’t have access right now…I mean…This is the last time we are with this group. That’s why everybody is giving it to you. 

00:35:59:00

Will: I know. That was the whole point of what I said. 

Ashley: Oh.

Vika: Oh damn it! …Okay.

00:37:00:00

-

00:38:00:00

-

00:39:17:00

Salah: What did they say?

Vika: Hm? Hm?

Salah: Which point did they say? For me they are still talking about nine twenty-eight. 

Will: Oh, they’ve already uploaded the point. It’s already in the…

Salah: Hmm.

00:40:22:20

Oleg: Will, how does your temperature affect your metrics? Or you do not appreciate it at all?

Will: You don’t have to do it that’s my job. 

Ashley: Wait, what just happened? Why did everything just go blank in the sign-off?

 Will: Mine isn’t blank.

Ashley: Mine is completely blank now, and it was just filled in. By everyone. Basically. 

Oleg: Will, do you work only with two indicators: material of LHSB and [UI]?

Will:  I even... for the most part, I don't even look at them. It is for the structural geologist. 
The most important thing for me is, in fact, how much water and how much ...

00:41:08:20

Oleg: And what is the parameter? What is it called?

Will: It is called «average water loss».

Oleg: Yep.

Vika: Hello there. Important. 

Will: Oh, man!

00:42:00:05

Will: Oh, man. You took away the little shrugging guy. 

Ashley: Who?

Salah: Huh? 

Will: Salah, he deleted the shrug guy. They had a shrug guy.

Vika: Shrug guy? What?

Ashley: I don’t think…

Will: In the name. In the name. 

Ashley: Did you delete something in the name?

Salah: No, nothing. 

Will: You changed the name. 

Salah: I put Sirius only. I put…

Will: Yeah, but then you deleted the rest of it. Because there was another part at the end. 

Salah: No, see? It’s still Sirius. 

Will: Yeah, yeah. I know, but …Sirius. But the other one had…

Ashley: It had, apparently, a little emoji. 

Salah: Oh. 

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: Are you guys seeing my human factors decisions on the bottom? Filled in all the way at the bottom.

Salah: Oh, okay. 

00:42:58:05

Will: Human…

Ashley: Why is it not showing up?

Salah: Me too. Actually, I don’t see for anyone.

Ashley: I don’t understand. 

Will: It’s like seven six eight?

Ashley: Yeah?

Will: Yeah.

Ashley: You see that? 

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: How’s the things are going on?

Will: It’s just taking a lot of time for stuff to process in the system. 

Oleg: Did you circle everything [SL] too?

Vika: Why is the dot here nine twenty-eight?

Ashley: What?

Oleg: Did you circle everything too? 

Vika: Okay.

Oleg: [SL] Sign off.

Ashley: It seems to me that not everything is shown here yet.

Oleg: [SL] Where is the meteorologist?

Vika: Stop! 

00:44:16:00

Oleg: They killed it again. 

Ashley: Hm?

Oleg: The signal I killed again. I see. [SL] МТС… Is this your antics? Vika?

Vika: Hm?

Oleg: Is this your antics name? [SL] Eww МТС.

Vika: No. No, I didn't change anything. 

Oleg:// [SL] When will it end?

Salah: //Why did you change it?

Will: I didn’t change it. 

Salah: I think they don’t understand Russian, so they can’t read it. 

00:45:01:00

Vika: How can you…how can you do that?

Will: What?

Vika: I mean…

Salah: Name?

Vika: How can you change?

Salah: It’s [UI]

Vika: Yeah, but you have…

Salah: We have the permission to change name.

Will: She knows how to change it because she changed it. 

Salah: She put «Eww».

Will: Unless you changed it. I mean, she is the one…

Ashley: Wait, you didn’t put the «Eww»?

Vika: No!

Will: No. She did. 

Vika: No. 

Will: Look at her: “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”.

Vika: No, really, I didn’t. 

Oleg: Do you see that?

Ashley: Well, I can't right now because...

Vika: Wait. Wait. Wait, wait. 

Salah: Eww, right?

Vika: No that wasn’t me. 

Salah: Ew?

Vika: Nope. It’s not me. 

Will: Oh, wait, never mind. We can just look at the…

Vika: Never mind. 

Will: Oh, it was you!!

Ashley: No, it wasn’t!

Salah: Ash, yeah?

Ashley: //No, I really didn’t!! I didn’t do that!

Vika: //Oh, it was Ash! Yeah! Yes, yes. Ash! 

Oleg: Wait.

Will: I can even track the user who changed something in the thing. 

Ashley: But I didn’t change the title.

Oleg: Stop. Who are the [UI]

Will: Martian meteorologist specialist changed name at 3:08PM.

00:45:58:45

Ashley: I didn’t do it though! I’m serious! I didn’t do it! 

Will: Maybe it was [SL] Aslan. 

Salah: Oh!

Ashley: I don’t even have Russian keyboard in here. 

Will: So, it could’ve been Salah. Salah changed name at 3:07.

Salah: It’s the same thing. Except…

Will: But at some point, you did change the name, so…

Salah: Then, again, in Sirius only. 

Vika: Uh-oh. 

Salah: But «eww»? Vika? Or Ash?

Will: No. I don’t know. // It says…it’s either you or her. 

Ashley: //I swear, I haven’t even put my cursor on the title.

Will: But the…

Ashley: I don’t have a Russian keyboard on here. 

Vika: Really? Why?

Salah: Maybe it’s you, Will? //You changed it to «eww»?

Ashley: //Because we are Americans. We don’t need it on the NASA laptop.

Will: Yeah, but you would have to change your name too. Fluid engineer: «You rock!». Yes!

Salah: Who?

Will: Yes! That’s the…struct geo changed it.

Ashley: They said they changed it?

Will:  Yeah, they changed it now, because that’s, apparently…

00:47:01:30

Will: When fluid engineer changed it, I told fluid engineer, “You rock!” And, so, they must have told that to…to them. 

Ashley: What?

Will: Just look at the thing.

Ashley: I can’t! I have to answer these fucking questions! 

Vika: But how...

Oleg: Is it changing?

Vika: Will…

Will: Wait. Wait. No, it’s not it. Like you need to do it before you...

Salah: I can’t use it. 

Vika: For example...

Will: No, no. You need to write it// before...

Salah: //[UI] showing here, huh?

Oleg: [SL] Mac. [SL] Mac.

Will: Mac y’all are lit. 

Vika: Is it yours?

Will: Yes. This means they are good. 

Salah: What is it?

Will: It’s in here, look. «Change name». You can see it.

00:48:00:50

Ashley: Wait, where?

Will: “Choose name”. It’s the bottom side of activity log. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Vika: Where?  I don’t see the arrow. 

Will: This one.

Vika: Okay. 

Salah: [UI]

Oleg: It’s done, they are now confirming. 

Will: Sign-off activity log. 

Salah: Hm?

Ashley: Oh my God, I still can’t answer these fucking questions. 

Will: If it’s like the third one, I’d just fucking write it on, because it isn’t really…

Salah: Maybe [SL] Rustam?

Vika: Fire? ...But how? Look. I mean, I can write here now, Will. I can write something here. And then how can I confirm it?

00:49:00:00

Will: Well... you just press it.

Ashley: So, I don’t understand. All my decisions on my screen are showing up not there anymore. Do you guys see my stuff anymore?

Will: I’m not sure. I wouldn’t…

Vika: Someone is playing with you. 

Oleg: So who the hell is out there?

Vika: Where are you? I can’t see you at all. 

Ashley: For specimen factor decisions…Oh my God, why is it doing this? It’s so weird. Sign-off phase is killing me. 

Salah: I can see it now. See?

00:50:00:12

Ashley: Yeah. 

Vika: And you also do not have your dots there ...

Will: Did you remove the…name? Let me see. 

Vika: Do we need to //insert our own? Own numbers?

Salah: //No, you can see. 

Ashley: //Yeah, but I did not pay attention to that at all because I’m having issues. 

Will: //What? We don’t need to. We just....

Vika: //Usually not, but look. Neither structural geologist, nor you or me have them. 

Salah: //Which issue?

Ashley: My decisions just keep deleting. 

Will: Yes, you can understand, but I can't.

Vika: Ah, it's like only when it's okay. So I need this time? I do not understand. No, I didn't understand. Yes. I understood. 

00:50:59:15

Oleg: Seems like you do not have time to write something already. 

Ashley: I told //that I have problems.

Vika: //Will!

Will: What?

Vika: We usually have…

Will: Can you cancel? 

Vika:  //No I can not. 


Oleg: //What's your problem?

Ashley: //Every time I give... See this? Well, now it holds, and then it always zeroed [annulled]. 

Will: //Then shut up.

Vika: //But it’s on here, what can I do now.

Will: //What do you mean?

Vika: //Well, when it's on, it means you can take something out and sign it.
 
Will: No, it //means that you...that it's yours.

Oleg: Mine is still holding. Well, you've had it before, haven't you?

Will: Mine is on, mine…//This is so that you know who you are. It’s ok. Do you know who you are?

Ashley: Yes, but then it was shown: “No decision”. Can’t get it. Do you see my decision?

Vika: //Yes.

Oleg: //Not yours. 

Will: //Are you sure? Because...

Ashley: In the end? Do you see it there. 

Oleg: Right…Human…human…

Ashley: Yes. These are mine.

Vika: Better eat something. Good girl. //Since you can't say anything.

Oleg: //I see you have specimen factor. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Oleg: All of your points are here. //Five, six, seven, six, six. Why....why are they so low? Oh, it’s on a ten-point scale, right?

Vika: //Finally.

Ashley: Up to twelve points. //So, these are mine, right?

Vika: //Why is it taking so long today? Anyway...

00:52:00:10

Oleg: Yes. 

Will: Eww!

Vika: Which eww?

Oleg: Only Will's data is empty. 

Will: Yes, it's kind of weird. 

Vika: Very odd. 

Oleg: And the same with Vika. 

Salah: Vika, can I have the…

Vika: Which flavor do you want?

Salah: Any one. The other, yeah. 

00:53:13:15

Will: You may avoid writing "eww” since they just don’t understand it. 

Vika: It wasn't me who wrote "eww".

Will: Ah. “Very eww”

Vika: I wrote “Very eww”. 

Salah: For what «very eww»? 

Vika: Huh?

Salah: You? 

Vika: «very eww», yes. But previous was «eww», and it wasn’t me. …It was…

Salah: You, Ash? Or…

Ashley: Again, I do not have a Russian keyboard, so…

Oleg: Оh! 

Salah: Maybe Oleg. 

Oleg: Yep, maybe.

Salah: Eww?

Ashley: Oleg.

Vika: Meteorologist specialist it was. 

Will: Mhm.

Ashley: I didn’t do it, I swear. 

Oleg: It’s over, now there is a normal name.

00:54:00:10

Salah: There is something if we change the name?

Will: Hm?

Salah: Something will happen if we change the name?

Oleg: My turn. [SL] Party. МТС. ... what takes so long to choose there, huh?

00:54:59:10

Will: I wrote to them that our...

Vika: Yes I see. 

Salah: To sign off?

Will: Oh, yeah. 

Vika: What could you see? My computer is frozen.

Will: Added a real cool thing. 

Ashley: Who put emojis now?

Will: Not us. That would be them. 

Ashley: I don’t know. Material specialist…

Will: Oh! I see it! I like it! Do you have an emojis list?

Salah: You have also. 

Ashley: Where? How?

Vika: Where?

Salah: Just right click, the first one. 

Vika: What?

Salah: This on the left.

Will: Yeah, just…

Salah: Yeah. This is emoji. 

Will: Oh, my man! Hooking it up. 

Ashley: Up? Where?

Salah: Okay, you just click here. Right click. 

Vika: Wow!!

Salah: Right click right here. 

00:55:59:00

Ashley: Oh, and then it’s also the // windows, the windows sign… Oh, shit.

Will: //Okay, alright. They are…they are telling: “Everybody sign off”.

Salah: Oh. 

Oleg: Yes. Ash, are you hell around?

Vika: Are we signing too?

Will: Yes. 

Salah: Sorry, guys. I changed the name to «eww».

Vika: We knew that. 

Ashley: All y’all blaming me.

Vika: Yes, of course. 

Will: What I wanna know is how…how does it say that it would be her doing it, though? Interesting. 

Ashley: I genuinely don’t know about that one, because I really did not go into the name at all. 

Vika: Interesting. Did you really think that we would believe in your words. 

00:57:00:00

Will: What’s up?

Vika: What?

Salah: Sign off [UI]

Oleg: [UI]. Sit silently and make her dirty little changes. 

Vika: It was me. Sorry, it was me. 

Will: [PH] Bep.

Vika: [PH] Bep. 

Oleg: Who else could it be?

Will: Fluid, maintenance, Martian terrain specialist.

Salah: Martian terrain specialist and maintenance specialist has to…

Ashley: It’s the same person since maintenance didn’t show up today…My team!

Salah: Your team?

Will: Ew.

00:57:59:20

Ashley: Yeah. 

Salah: Tell them. 

Oleg: So, it’s the…

Salah: Tell them to sign off.

Will: Almost. 

Oleg: One more. Alright. 

Salah: Yeah, maintenance. 

Will: Done.

Vika: God, how long!

Will: //God, what a man!

Ashley: //You! Now! DeСhurch nine!

Will: To this day I still have no idea how you do it that fast.

Ashley: I don’t either. 

Vika: I know. 

Salah: You said that hers [UI].

Oleg: Salah, are you out?

Vika: Will, how much battery percentage do you have? Thanks Will. 

01:04:54:20

Vika: Oh, is it all? Be careful, the speaker will fall now. 

Will: Fine. 

Vika: No it’s not. No.

Salah: Hm?

Vika: No way.

Salah: Are you done?

Vika: Yes.

Salah: Go to the second one. 

Vika: No.

Salah: [UI]

Vika: //No rush, no rush.

Oleg: //Ash, I'm having the same bullshit again now.

Salah: This is an important thing. 

Vika: //No, no, no!

Oleg: //See, we sent, I turned off now, I saw it, right? It is the same. Do you remember when I had a file…the same.

Vika: It’s so important thing.

Salah: Really important cause.

Ashley: It's not even from today.

Oleg: Thirty-first. 31.05.2022.

Salah: So important.

Ashley: Ah, yes 

Oleg: Here, I now started it again.

01:06:00:00

Ashley: Why don't you delete this video? 

Oleg: //I have enough space.

Salah: //[UI] 

Ashley: Yes, but... Okay.

Salah: Why? 

Vika: Important.

Salah: Okay, so, go here. Desktop…

Oleg: There I have //about twenty gigabytes. 

Salah: //Wait, wait, wait.

Vika: Here, it’s here! 

Oleg: On this computer...

Salah: Which one?

Ashley: Have you tried on others… //to use it for twenty minutes not in the session, to make a video at another time and watch? Don't know. 

Salah: //[UI] and select.

Vika: //Oh, thank you so much! Thank you! How can I…

Salah: //For my service, yeah?
 
Vika: Okay. So, what should I choose?

Oleg: I didn’t get it. What’s the point? 

Salah: Input.

Oleg: //What is this for?

Vika:  //Oh, nice!

Ashley: Don't know. Do you have any idea why his videos keep fucking up?

Will: What do you mean? I mean, when you finish?

Oleg: No, she saw it herself. The indicator went off. I’m watching, but the file is not played. I have restarted now. 

01:07:00:25

Will: Maybe just because of a memory? Do you have a memory there?

Oleg: Yes, there is. 

Will: Well, I do not know. Nice trick.

Vika: So important. Ash…Hm, good idea. [UI]

Salah: They still? Huh?

Will: Huh?

Salah: They still? The chat…

Will: Oh, I’m just trying. I don’t even know if they are still there. 

Oleg: //I have updated now. It launches again. 

Salah: //I log out. I log out after we sign off.

01:08:00:00

Will: I leave it up so I can see if there is any extra messages. 

Oleg: No, it’s not it. 

Ashley: What?

Oleg: I’m having pretty much of it. On the thirty-first...eleven...

Vika: So important.

Oleg: It turned on and off several times. I don't even understand why. 

Vika: [UI]

Oleg: Do you know how many times it turned on with me?

Salah: You didn’t understand the name //when I put the emojis? For old man and old woman. 

Oleg: //Look. One, two, three, four and, here's one of them – nine hundred ninety-eight [UI]

Vika: //What?

Salah: //So important. 

Vika: Ah, oh.

Salah: That’s why. //British people, you know?

Oleg: //Forty-eight megabytes. And now it's recording again. Four videos.

01:08:58:00

Ashley: [UI]

Salah: I think it would be much better for Project RED if we had a // general chat. All of us to talk together. Not that we go to talk one by one. 
Oleg: [SL] //Now there are four of them. Three minutes in here, one minute here, one minute here. 

Ashley: //Here, too, was twice. 

Will: Maybe, but it also might be like…

Salah: I think it would be more funny, you know. 

Will: That would definitely be true.

Ashley: Alright, we should end here. 

Vika: Let's write him. Or at least take a picture together.

Will: Alright. 

Salah: [UI]

Will: [UI]

Vika: So important. 

01:10:22:00

Vika: Why are you playing this very mode?

Will: Just a family thing. 

Vika: Family?

Will: Yep. Mom said it saved her. You want to turn the…

Salah: Why?

Will: I don’t know. 

Vika: But it won't save you.

Will: This. It’s true. That's when mom did...did...

Salah: How to change the level from easy to…This is medium or…

Will: This is random. I play hard, easy. Whatever. 

Salah: What?

Vika: You can’t, you can’t, you can’t…

Will: I don’t know. I think it should be…

01:11:09:00

Will: It may not be hard or easy. It may just be [UI] you can change it. 

Salah: Okay, //[UI]

Will: //But I don’t think it’s…This is [SL] free cell. This is different.

Salah: [SL] Free cell, yeah. [SL] Oh, okay, okay,

Oleg: What mode do you change?

Will: Well my mom played it when she was working on her PhD work, and it... she said it was the worst thing ever and the best thing for her because she...

Vika: Could get a bit of a relief from science. 

Will: Yes, but on the one hand, it distracted her and helped, and on the other hand, it distracted her.

01:11:58:00

Vika: What about the third one? What about the third one? So important.

Salah: Wait.

Oleg: Salah, what are you doing?

Will: Turn…turn the [UI]

Ashley: Maybe…What?

Vika: Interesting.

Vika: So important. 

01:15:52:10

Ashley: It’s so awkward… What are you doing, Salah? You literally…

Salah: What?

Ashley: You sent it back to the same person that sent it to you.

Vika: Of course! 

Salah: It was…

Will: Hey! No talking!

Vika: Eww! ....Easy! Easy, easy, baby!

Ashley: Okay, okay. You're right.

Vika: Nobody will believe you. Even if you're right. 

Will: I'm sorry, didn't you hear what I said? It doesn't say here.
