Ashley: And then //press the red button.

Oleg: //[UI]

Ashley: Okay. Today is November 30th, 2021. It’s mission day twenty-six. The time is 3:25 PM Moscow time. Three, two, one. //Mark.

All: //Mark. 

Ashley: Don’t minimize. Don’t minimize.

00:00:31:02

Katya: Corect.

Will: Open Design, yes?

Ashley: Yeah. Open Design. 

Oleg: Video Design?

Ashley: Hm? On the Desktop.

Oleg: Yes. 

Ashley: It’s there.

Oleg: Project RED Design? Yes?

Ashley: Mhm. 

Oleg: Is the video there?

Ashley: What?

00:01:00:12

Oleg: Video.

Vika: Program.

Ashley: No, Program. Project RED Design. Down.

Oleg: Oh, this thing.

Will: Uh-oh. 

Oleg: Is it loaded?

Ashley: Yes. And your password will be in your book. On page number one. 

00:01:33:12

Oleg: Okay…User?

Ashley: User is also there. Yours…specific to you. Here. 

00:01:43:08 – 00:02:32:02

[no audio]

Ashley: You can send. 

Katya: Too bad, there’s no emoji. 

Ashley: Messages to your team. 

00:02:43:06 – 00:03:29:00

[no audio]

Will: Well, shall we look?

Ashley: Mhm. 

Oleg: I wonder if the parameters are the same or they have changed them already. 

00:03:42:23 – 00:04:23:15

[no audio] 

Katya: Please check twenty-seven four. 

Will: I can’t select anything.

Katya: Oh, we can’t talk?

Wil: I can’t. Twenty-seven four?

Katya: Twenty-seven four.

Wil: Yes. 

Oleg: Twenty-seven zero four, yes?

Katya: Yes. 

Oleg: Nothing yet. 

Vika: Very expensive. 

Ashley: You only think about money. 

Vika: It’s my job. 



00:04:59:19

Katya: And what about thirty-eight twenty, for example?

Vika: Thirty-eight twenty?

Will: Have you gotten any messages from me?

Ashley: From…

Will: Me. Can you check?

Vika: No.

Ashley: I…

Vika: There are very many contaminants there.

Ashley: You are the sedimentologist, right?

Will: Yeah. 

Oleg: It is not…

Vika: At a minimum.

00:05:30:16

Ashley: Katya, what did you say?

Katya: Forget that one. It doesn’t work.

Vika: Twenty…twenty-seven four. Can you check, please?

Ashley: Yeah. It’s not bad for me, actually.

Oleg: Is it working alright for everyone?

Ashley: Is there water there, to begin with?

Will: No, it’s not working for me. 

Katya: [UI]

Oleg: Not working either?

Vika: Ah. Are you the materials specialist? Oh. //Thank you so much. 

Oleg: //[UI]. There is no camera. It doesn’t open. Here, see?

00:05:59:14

Oleg: I ask, and it…

Ashley: This…okay…

Oleg: Even so.

Katya: I’ve found an amazing place. Nineteen forty-three. 

Ashley: At first, I had the same thing and //I had to close and open it again.

Katya: //Nineteen forty-three.

Vika: Checking.

Katya: //Magnificent.

Vika: //Really? Are there palm trees and cocktails there?

Oleg: //So, what are you opening? So, is it all of it?

Ashley: Everything. Yes. 

Vika: So, what’s there?

00:06:29:25

Katya: Well, what do you think?

Vika: In terms of contamination, it’s not very good.

Katya: Not very good?

Vika: Mhm-m. 

Katya: Well, is it habitable? Or is it just, completely…

Vika: I am looking at my parameters. 

Ashley: And what about twenty-six thirty-nine?

Salah: Which was, Katya? Twelve forty-three?

Katya: Right now, nineteen forty-three. 

Salah: Mhm.

Katya: Nineteen forty-three. Who? What did you say to me just now?

Ashley: Maybe, twenty-six thirty-nine?

00:07:00:14

Katya: Twenty-six thirty-nine. 

Will: Mhm. Can you give me the other link, Ash?

Ashley: Link for…

Will: There should be another link in the…

Salah: Yeah, this is good. 

Will: I don’t have the thing, but //inside the notebook. 

Vika: //Not too good. 

Katya: So long, Salah. 

Ashley: Yeah. …You know what? Here is this. 

Will: Thank you. 

Ashley: Let me also look in the…

00:07:30:07

Vika: There //the depth is great. 

Ashley: //In here. I think they wrote something.

Katya: Maybe, sixteen forty-one?

Vika: //Katya, there will be enough water there.

Will: //[UI]

Vika: Twenty-six thirty-nine.

Katya: Really? //And look at eight forty-seven, too.

Vika: //Yes, but there is contamination there. Say again.

Katya: Eight forty-seven. 

Ashley: Forty-seven…

Vika: // Eight forty-seven…

Will: //I think…

00:08:02:13

Ashley: And they only have a backup for the Relay here.

Salah: Again?

Vika: So…

Katya: //Eight forty-seven.

Will: //That’s alright. 

Ashley: //Is it not working at all? I mean, I know I had to close my all and restart it all at one point because point cells weren’t working. 

Katya: //Can you check this, Salah? Eight forty-seven. 

Vika: //Hold on. Just a second. Looking for the parameters. 

Salah: //Forty-seven…

Will: Yeah. So, what’s happening now?

Oleg: The greatest one is twenty twenty-eight. Has anyone looked?
Ashley: Twenty //twenty-eight

Oleg: //Twenty-eight. 

Ashley: I will look…

Salah: This one is good. 

00:08:31:12

Salah: Eight forty-seven.

Katya: Yeah. 

Salah: What do you think, guys?

Vika: Yeah. I like it. 

Ashley: It’s an average one for me. 

Salah: Why? [UI]?

Oleg: What don’t you like?

Ashley: Because the…//there are many red and orange zones there. 

Vika: //Oh, excellent. And in terms of water loss, it’s simply ideal. 

Ashley: What’s “orange”?

Will: Hm?

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: Look, Ash. //Ash. I’ve been thrown out again.

Vika: //What’s the matter…damn! 

Ashley: Yes. Me too. So, it’s okay. They, just…

00:08:59:17

Ashley: It’ll simply say that there will be an opportunity there //to give your data later. But now we are not giving anything anymore.
Katya: //Only the geologist team [UI]. So, and who are the geologists here? Come on.

Will: //Oh! At last! 

Vika: //It’s us. 

Ashley: Is it working now?

Will: What’s the number?

Katya: Eight twenty…

Vika: Eight forty-seven.

Katya: Eight forty-seven. 

Vika: Check, please.

Oleg: Eight forty-seven. 

Ashley: Eight forty-seven. 

Salah: This is good for me. 

Vika: For me too.

Salah: Eight forty-seven.

00:09:33:21

Oleg: Yes, it’s amazing. 

Ashley: So-so for me. 

Oleg: Sixty-six. 

Vika: That’s something.

Salah: [SL]How?

Vika: [UI]

Ashley: So, it’s like fifty-fifty for me. //There is a lot of mountains, a lot of craters, a lot of icecaps there. 
Katya: //Lobbying interests. 

Ashley: Population reached is very high, though. Location accessibility also very high. 

00:10:01:09

Ashley: So, that’s good. 

Katya: It’s expensive for us to drill, because the ground is not very good...but it’s very close, so it’s ok.

Vika: And did you reject twenty-seven four?

Katya: Twenty-seven four?

Ashley: I thought that [UI]

Katya: It’s very expensive. Yes.

Vika: Okay.

Ashley: Very expensive. 

00:10:33:20

Vika: Okay. 

Ashley: And who can tell us how much water…

Salah: Check twelve forty-four. 

Ashley: is there in one spot?

Oleg: William.

Ashley: Is William //the one who can?

Will: //What am I doing?

Vika: //Forty-four?

Salah: //Twelve forty-four. 

Ashley: //Can you tell us how much water there is there?
Will: Yes.

Katya: Tell us. 

Ashley: Was it twelve forty-four?

Will: I don’t know because it looks like this one loses 100% water in the flow.

00:11:03:06

Katya: It’s such a perfect place!

Ashley: Losing water?

Will: Yes.

Katya: //Oh my God!

Vika: //Which one is that? Eight forty-seven?

Ashley: It’s not bad. Not bad. 

Katya: It’s, like…

Ashley: It’s not the best but it’s not bad. 

Salah: It means “okay”. 

Katya: Guys, twelve forty-four. 

Will: I…

Ashley: Twelve forty-four?

Will: Yes.

Vika: Twelve forty-four. 

Ashley: Let’s see. 

00:11:30:23

Vika: Mhm. 

Ashley: Accessibility high. A lot of orange and red zones there. //Not the best. But… 

Will: //Okay. It’s a bit better. 

Katya: A bit better than eight, right?

Will: Yes, yes, yes. It’s like, eight – complete loss. And this one – half. 

Katya: Here – supercell. 

Vika: Twenty-nine…//Yes. I like it for the water flow. Will we be able to remove the murky contaminants?

Katya: //Let’s look at twenty forty-four. 

Salah: //What’s from your side?

Will: //Huh?

Salah: //From your side?

Will: //It’s okay. 

Salah: //Twelve forty-four?

00:12:00:03

Oleg: Are these murky?

Vika: Yes. 

Will: Twelve forty-four is okay. 

Vika: 70%. It’s twelve forty-four. If we can, it works for me.

Oleg: Hold on. 

Ashley: Six…six…

Salah: And Ashley?

Ashley: What did you say?

Salah: Twelve forty-four. Because he said okay, drilling – okay, for me – okay, Vika – okay. 
Ashley: Two, three…fine…

Oleg: So, twelve forty-four. 

00:12:36:15

Vika: Or is it on this page?

Oleg: So…very many…hot there. [UI]…Seventy…it’s too much…it will be only…

00:13:00:21

Oleg: Too much…okay, seventy…

Ashley: …Pretty high and will cost four times as much as two [UI]. So, if I have six and [UI]. [UI]. Okay. 

00:13:35:25

Ashley: Two…Okay, [SL] I will find out. 

Oleg: It’s too much [UI]. 

Ashley: And the red is //[UI]

Oleg: //Up to 60% water loss. 

Ashley: Twelve forty-four could work. 

Vika: Hm?

Ashley: Twelve forty-four could work. It could be…

00:13:59:25

Vika: But Oleg said that [UI]

Ashley: Oh.

Will: Who said?

Ashley: What?

Vika: Oleg said that it’s not a good place. 

Ashley: Well. Well then. 
Salah: Who said twenty forty-four?

Ashley: Twenty forty-four?

Salah: Yeah. 

Will: Twenty forty-four?

Salah: Mhm. 

00:14:33:08

Ashley: That’s pretty good. 

Vika: Twenty twenty-four. 

Salah: Forty-four. 

Vika: Forty. Ah!

Will: Too much water loss. 

Ashley: Too much water loss?

Will: Yeah. //97%.

Oleg: //Wait. You’ve already said that one. And, you…

Katya: Okay. Which one then? Maybe, eight forty-seven?

Vika: Ah, twenty, yeah. 

Katya: So, then we are keeping eight forty-seven, yes?

Vika: Yeah. Oh, eight forty-seven…

00:14:59:29

Ashley: //Eight forty-seven is not bad.

Vika: //Will said that…

Ashley: Oh. 

Vika: that the flow.

Oleg: Oh, no. 

Katya: No, he said it’s at twenty forty-four. //At eight forty-seven, too?

Vika: //High level of water loss. 

Will: Yes. //100%.

Oleg: //[UI]

Katya: Hold on. Where do we have no water loss //from those suggested? 

Vika: //Check twenty-seven four, please.

Will: Twelve forty-four.

Katya: Is twelve forty-four okay as well?

Will: Yes.

Ashley: Did you say that twenty forty-four is okay?

Will: Twelve forty-four is okay.

Ashley: Twelve. Good.

Oleg: At twelve forty-four there will be 60% expenses…

00:15:31:06

Oleg: or there will be losses during filtration. 

Will: Mhm.

Salah: What’s wrong with it?

Vika: High level of contamination. 

Ashley: 60% is going to be lost for cleaning…or filtering. 

Vika: Yeah. Because of the high level of contaminators. 

Ashley: Well. //Has anybody heard from the Chicago team yet?

Katya: //Have we decided on something?

Will: Yep. Yep, yep. 

Ashley: I have not heard from them yet. 

Katya: Eight forty-seven, still. 

00:16:02:28

Oleg: Is eight forty-seven good for you?

Katya: Yes, eight forty-seven. Does everyone agree that this option is not too bad? I’ll suggest it to my people.

Oleg: Yes. Eight forty-seven…

Vika: Yes, eight forty-seven – a lot of water loss. So, 100%? Will.

Will: Yes.

Katya: No. //Where is it not great?

Will: //Which one?

Vika: Eight forty-seven.

Will: Twelve forty-four.

Katya: Twelve forty-four.

Will: It’s 50% loss there.

Oleg: But there will be 60% loss.

Will: But he says that there will be. //It means that…

Oleg: //During filtration. 

Katya: So, at the moment, there isn’t a single option that works for us. 



00:16:28:20

Will: We can only take 20% of water from there. 

Ashley: So, I’ve received a message that…

Vika: Hold on, eight forty-seven…

Salah: Twelve forty-four?

Katya: It doesn’t work for him either. 

Vika: Oh, no? Well, that’s it then.

Ashley: //I got a message that the geologists want us to look at thirty-seven thirty-six.

Salah: //Twelve forty-four. 

Oleg: Six thirty-seven.

Ashley: Thirty-seven thirty-six. 

Oleg: And six thirty-seven for me. 

Salah: Hm?

Ashley: So, what about the others.

Katya: Thirty-seven thirty-six.

Ashley: So, I got a message saying to look at thirty-seven thirty-six. 

Vika: Thirty-seven thirty-six. High level of contamination. 

00:17:00:13

Will: Which one?

Katya: Not bad.

Vika: Thirty-seven thirty-six.

Katya: Is it really high?
Vika: Yes, pretty high. 

Oleg: And what about six thirty-seven?

Vika: Mineral contamination is over 60%.

Will: Thirty-seven…

Oleg: Six thirty-seven.

Salah: Okay. 

Will: Six thirty-seven. 

Ashley: Well, both of them.

Oleg: Oh, no. 

Ashley: We got //two different messages. 

Oleg: //No, it is…

Katya: Listen, well, //six thirty-seven is okay.

Will: //Six thirty-seven?

Ashley: His was six thirty-seven. 

Oleg: There is too //much murky water and small contaminants.

Ashley: //The one that I got was thirty-seven thirty-six.

Will: Okay. 

Oleg: So, we will lose too much.

Ashley: And what about thirty-seven thirty-six?

00:17:30:07

Oleg: Thirty-seven thirty-six. Just a second. 

Vika: The contamination is high as well. 

Ashley: There? High contamination. 

Will: Six thirty-seven. A lot of water loss, but it may do. 

Vika: Oleg, what will you say in terms of filtration? 

Will: Thirty-seven thirty-six is good. 

Katya: //Thirty-seven thirty-six.

Oleg: //Oh! It’s really…

Ashley: Yes?

Oleg: Mineral …and murky water.

Will: Thirty-seven //thirty-six?

Ashley: //Thirty-seven thirty-six?

Oleg: Yes. Thirty-seven thirty-six is very dirty. So, we…

00:17:59:24

Will: Oh. Mhm. 

Oleg: We will lose a lot during filtration…It’s all within 60%.

Ashley: So, high contamination at thirty-seven thirty-six.

Vika: Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. …And eight forty-seven wasn’t good because of what?

Will: Loss of all the water. 

Ashley: Mhm.

00:18:33:22

Katya: Did we check six thirty-seven?

Vika: Yes.

Will: Mhm.

Katya: It doesn’t work either?

Salah: Can you check twenty-three thirty-nine?

Katya: Mhm. …Thirty-nine, yes?

Salah: Mhm. 

00:19:04:07

Katya: Oleg, who do you have? Engineer, right? Fluid?

Oleg: I have //no. Biochemical.

Katya: //Biomechanical? Biochemical engineer. 

00:19:13:02 – 00:20:05:22

[no audio]

Katya: [SL] Very good. 

Vika: What?

Katya: Twenty-three thirty-nine. 

Vika: Just checking.

Salah: You checked?

Katya: [UI]

Will: Twenty-three thirty-nine is possible. 

Vika: Is it okay for me to live?

00:20:33:08

Vika: So. Katyusha, say it one more time.

Katya: Twenty-three thirty-nine.

Vika: No. A lot…very contaminated water. 

Katya: Everybody likes eight forty-four here. 

Will: I don’t like eight forty-four. Too bad.

Katya: Mhm.

00:21:01:16

Ashley: [UI]

Katya: Look at thirty-seven and three, maybe. In a flat area.

00:21:32:28

Ashley: Thirty-seven and what?

Katya: And three. Thirty-seven three point. 

Will: Not bad. 

Salah: Eight forty-seven. 

Ashley: We already looked at that one before. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Will: Thirty-seven and three is fine. 

Ashley: We excluded that one. 

Salah: //Who said it’s not good?

Vika: //Water loss will be great. 

Will: Thirty-seven and three?

Ashley: He said that eight forty-seven will lose a lot of water. 

Katya: //Thirty-seven…

Vika: //Thirty-two thirty-two. Oh, hold on. 

00:22:00:21

Katya: Thirty-seven and three. Thirty-seven three. 

Vika: Mhm. 

Ashley: Okay. Is there water there?

Vika: Oleg, in terms of contamination, please tell me about thirty-seven and three. Because mineral contamination is almost 50%.

Oleg: So. Thirty-seven and three? …So, thirty-seven and three. 

Vika: Yes, great. Amazing. 

Will: It’s the closest thing we have to chips, I think. 

Ashley: What?

Oleg: //The loss will be 30% at most.

Will: //The closest thing we have to chips. 

Ashley: I know. 

Vika: Oh, really? //Perfect.

Will: //Chips would be nice. 

00:22:32:02

Ashley: I requested that [UI]. Pringles, please. 

Will: I mean, yeah. Pringles. Pringles would be good because it’s got the container. But we need fucking popcorn.

Ashley: I requested that, too. 

Will: Sorry about the swearing. 

Katya: So what? Then we are suggesting this, right?

Vika: Well, let’s.

Will: Thirty-seven and three? Yes?

Katya: Yes.

Vika: Well, it’s okay. 

Salah: What [UI]?

Katya: Thirty-seven three. 

00:23:21:06

Katya: Where did I send it? Well, okay.

Will: Yum-yum. Yum-yum. No. 

Vika: What?

Oleg: Ash.

Ashley: Hm?

Oleg: Where do you see the result of the calculations?

Ashley: What?

Oleg: Here. When you enter here into the calculator, where are the results displayed?

Ashley: It should come here.

Oleg: Well, look here. 

00:24:00:24

Oleg: Here I take this point, right? Right here. Here. Here it is. 

Ashley: And it came here. 

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: So…what do you want to do?

Oleg: Here. The things is that…Hold on, wait, I will select filters, for examples.

Ashley: Mhm.

Oleg: So, no. No. Here – filter. 

00:24:39:15

Ashley: What did they say the delay in communications is with them?

Will: I think it’s six to eight minutes. 

Salah: //It’s supposed to be six minutes. 

Ashley: //Like, one way or around?

Salah: Around. 

Will: Six minutes? Yeah, round trip. //If there’s one right away. 

Salah: //Or eight…But with them they are going to make it half day.

00:25:00:04

Salah: I think they don’t respond.  

Vika: Thirty-seven and three…Oh, “Good”, said the drilling specialist. 

Katya: Discussing it among ourselves. 

Vika: “Hi!”, “Oh, hi!”

Salah: Thirty-seven three?

Vika: Yep. 

Katya: Not bad.

Vika: Ours.

Salah: Yeah. 

Oleg: Ash. 

Vika: Excuse me, please. 

00:25:35:22

Vika: Mhmm…Not bad. …Not really.

00:25:59:24

Oleg: How do you like twenty-nine nineteen?

Will: They say that twenty forty-four works well for them. But I have to answer that, in fact, no.

Katya: It’s really great – twenty-nine nineteen.

Ashley: My…

Oleg: You like it too, don’t you?

Ashley: My team says that they are looking at 

00:26:29:02

Ashley: Twenty forty-four and seven thirty-eight. So, look. ...Twenty forty-four…

Oleg: Oh, no. It’s not at all…

Ashley: Oh, no. We already looked at this one.

Oleg: Yes. This one is not even considered. 

Ashley: And seven thirty-eight. 

Oleg: Seven thirty-eight?

00:27:03:08

Vika: Please check twenty-nine nineteen. 

Will: You said thirty-seven thirty-eight?

Ashley: Okay. I said, seven thirty-eight. So, seven thirty-eight. Sorry. 

Katya: Not a very good place, but let’s note it. 

Will: “Seventeen thirty-eight”. 

Ashley: Seven. Seven. Oh! Sorry. 

Oleg: Well, it is more or less.

Will: 100% water loss. 

Ashley: 100% water loss?

Oleg: Too deep. 

00:27:31:05

Oleg: A lot of losses. 

Salah: Can you check ten forty-seven?

Katya: Mhm.

Salah: Water loss. 

Ashley: Why wasn’t twenty forty-four good for us?

Salah: You checked? What?

Oleg: No. The water is too dirty. 

Ashley: So, dirty? Not clean?

00:28:00:08

Oleg: Yes. There, we have large…Well, really large, but so be it. The water there is murky.

Katya: Where is it?

Oleg: Twenty forty-four. The water there is murky and there are mineral contaminants. 

Katya: Oleg, look at ten forty-seven.

Ashley: What does that mean exactly?

Will: What?

Ashley: Murky and…

Will: It’s, like, muddy or…it’s, like, filled with stuff. 

Ashley:  I don’t think my …my messages show that they are sent and then…

00:28:30:21

Vika: A lot of water loss at //ten forty-seven.

Ashley: //That’s weird. 

Oleg: I like it. 

Ashley: I didn’t send it to them. I sent it to the human factors. 

Katya: And low flow.

Oleg: There was a request just now. 

Salah: Will…

Oleg: Forty-seven and three – that’s you, yes?

Salah: I’m sending you.

Will: Okay. 

Oleg: Katya, and you?

Katya: Yes, I think, yes. 

Will: Alright.             

00:29:00:00

-

00:29:29:18

Salah: [UI]

-

00:30:07:15

Will: Ten forty-seven. …It’s 100% and there is no water there. 

Katya: Where? Forty-seven?

Will: Ten forty-seven, yeah. 

00:30:31:14

Oleg: We were just considering it.

Katya: А thirty-seven and three?

Ashley: Thirty-seven and three. Let’s see what…

Oleg: Forty-seven, yes?

Katya: Mhm. Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven. 

Oleg: Oh, we looked at this one.

Katya: //Doesn’t work, does it?

Ashley: // Thirty-seven what?

Katya: Thirty-seven and three.

Will: Why? Because it is okay for me. What did we have there? You can…

Oleg: Mineral contamination is too great there. 

Will: What percentage is it?

00:30:59:07

Oleg: It will be…

Katya: 50%.

Oleg: Yes. About 50%. No. I will have losses of about 45–50%. 

Will: Well, listen, let’s do the math. So…from another…//So, from this we have a hundred and thirty.

Ashley: //How much?

Katya: //Thirty-seven…Thirty-seven and three.

Will: Times…//point sixty-five. How much do you lose?

Ashley: //Oh, we looked at it.

Oleg: 45%.

00:31:33:23

Will: So from there we can forty-six thousand... And from... what was it? Twelve forty-four?

Oleg: So, twelve forty-four?

Will: Yes, we already looked there. 

Oleg: Twelve forty-four – it was pretty dirty there. 

Will: Well, let’s look. 

Oleg: Hold on, hold on, hold on. 

Will: Because there is a lot of water there. 

Oleg: So, twelve forty-four…

00:32:00:15

Katya: And the location is good. 

Oleg: Oh, it’s about 60% loss there. 

Will: Sixty, okay. 

Oleg: The water is too murky. Small contaminants. 

Will: So…forty-three. Thus, the other one – forty-six. So, it’s a bit better than thirty-seven and three. It’s three thousand liters or gallons better there. 

Ashley: So, thirty-seven and three…

Will: At thirty-seven and three we can take forty-six thousand. 

00:32:31:17

Ashley: Okay. So, thirty-seven three has water, decent amount of water. It is a little bit contaminated.

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: But it’s still //workable. We can still work with that. 

Will: //We can still…can take forty-nine normal ones there. 

Ashley: It’s a lot of water there, and while it’s slightly contaminated, it’s workable for us. 

00:33:00:00

00:33:30:22

Vika: What is “disparate”?

Ashley: “Disparate”?

Will: “Different, differences”

Ashley: Like, “opposing” almost. 

Vika: Oh, okay. …[UI]

Ashley: it was…I guess that wasn’t …

Katya: Isn’t it “Disparate housewives”?

Ashley: No. So, that’s “desperate”, and this is “disparate”. 

00:34:03:04

Katya: Too difficult, okay. 

Ashley: They are spelled a little differently too. …Well, I’m waiting to hear back from my team if thirty-seven three is okay, since we like it. Right?

Salah: //Geologist said: “Looks quite desperate for amount of water available”.

Oleg: //Ash, show at least one of your calculations.

Ashley: //Say again.

Oleg: Calculations. 

00:34:31:11

Oleg: Where do you enter in the calculator?

Will: Desperate – it means…//” Desperate” and “disparate” – these are different things. Desperate – it…

Oleg: //Can you show how you do it?

Ashley: //Well, I do not alter this. It, just immediately gives this.

Katya: //Desperate. 

Oleg: Yes. It…

Will: Yes, it seems. //So, it means, you…

Oleg: //Where do you see the effectiveness?

Salah: What do they mean?

Ashley: //So, for example, I can’t see everything because I need the others from my team. So,

Will: //It means that they want something but it’s probably, like, It’s like your last option. I mean, it’s…

Katya: Are they are spelt differently.

Ashley: //I simply don’t use it. I just look at mine.

Will: //“Disparate” – it means “different things”. “Desperate” – it means that you want something, but it is, like, your last option.

Salah: //Desperate.

00:35:01:13

Oleg: //Yes, yes. 

Ashley: and not here. And…

Katya: Spelt differently?

Salah: //“Desperate” with “e”.

Will: //Yes, yes, yes.

Oleg: And for yours?

Ashley: //For mine, too.

Will: //” Disparate” through “I”; “desperate” through “e”.

Oleg: //That is, the same as I, for example, calculate. That is, I understand that these meters and these are here, approximately.

Katya: //Okay.

Will: //And it has “A”. “D-i-s-p-a-r-a-t-e”. 

Salah: //D-e…

Vika: Oh, okay. 

Oleg: So, I can’t give such //exact calculations.

Salah: s-p…

Will: //Twenty-nine nineteen. Has anyone checked twenty-nine nineteen?

Katya: //Twenty nineteen.

Ashley: //Just, it 

Will: //Twenty-nine nineteen. 

Vika: //Materials specialist answered. 

Ashley: There is a message from them that did not come too quickly. So,//I can’t make decisions here.

Katya: //Twenty nineteen, yes?

Will: //Twenty-nine nineteen.

00:35:30:19

Oleg: So, twenty nineteen. Just a second. 

Ashley: Twenty what?

Oleg: Twenty nine…

Will: Twenty-nine nineteen.

Ashley: Twenty-nine nineteen.

Will: Mhm. Not bad.

Katya: Twenty nineteen. Or twenty-nine?

Vika: Twenty-nine nineteen.

Katya: Twenty-nine. 

Vika: Twenty-nine.

Katya: My God!

Ashley: Not bad! 

Katya: [UI]

Ashley: I like it. 

Katya: //It’s so expensive!

Will: //How about you?

Katya: It’s expensive. 


00:35:58:16

Vika: You know, flying to Mars is also not an inexpensive thing. 

Katya: What do you think, Salik?

Ashley: I like it.

Oleg: //It’s incredible. 

Salah: //[UI]

Will: Incredible? //What is the percentage?

Salah: //Yeah, it’s good. Twenty-nine nineteen. 

Oleg: It’s about ten percent. So, hold on. First stage…Just a second. I have the first stage…

Ashley: Oh, I just got a //message from them; they are also saying twenty-nine nineteen. 

Katya: //Everything is perfect here. Does it work for you?

Vika: I wrote that. 

Katya: Does twenty nineteen work for you?

Vika: Yes. It’s good.

00:36:30:21

Oleg: [UI]

Vika: There is contamination, of course, but they…

Katya: Well, for us it’s not very good either.

Vika: They are only large. So, they can be filtered. [UI]

Katya: Maybe, money is not a problem.

Vika: //Especially in isolation.

Ashley: //So, maintenance and fundraising.

Katya: Especially other people’s money. 

00:37:03:12

Oleg: In short, about 40%.

Will: Loss? Oh, okay. 

Salah: Which one?

Ashley: How much?

Oleg: Forty. 

Ashley: Will be lost?

Vika: Energy or what?

Oleg: No. It’s water. //Water loss.

Salah:// Twenty-nine nineteen. 

Oleg: Two filters.

Ashley: Yeah, that’s working for my…Let’s see.

Will: Ninety-two, nonetheless. 

Ashley: I like that spot. 

00:37:30:00

-

00:37:55:20

Vika: Okay. 

00:38:39:02

Ashley: Oh, oops. Shit. 

Vika: What?

Oleg: Darn. 

00:38:59:17

Vika: I love it! Mm. …Who is not sure? Everyone. 

00:39:30:00

-

00:39:58:07

Salah: [UI]

00:40:00:00

-

00:40:38:05

Katya: Which one did we choose? Twenty nineteen, yes?

Oleg: Twenty-nine nineteen.

Katya: Twenty-nine nineteen.

Salah: So, our team is okay with twenty-nine nineteen. Operations, materials, drilling. 

00:41:01:13

Will: Twenty nineteen?

Salah: Yeah.

Will: Good?

Salah: Yes. 

Ashley: Twenty-nine nineteen?

Will: Twenty nineteen?

Salah: Twenty-nine nineteen.

00:41:28:26

Vika: “How about y’all?” – it is “How about you?”?

Will: It’s “you”. 

Vika: Okay. Ah, “you all”. Okay. …Hello, [UI]

Ashley: It’s so nice. I like it. …Oh, that’s me. That’s what I mean. So, if it says that it’s your range zone, it means that there is //[UI]

Vika: //Twenty-nine nineteen – is it also good?

Oleg: //We’ve already looked at twenty-nine nineteen. 

00:42:00:23

Oleg: Yes, good. //40%.

Ashley: //So, that means that I’m assuming that if there is a zero for safe zones, that means that there is //not a frequency of [UI] storms. 

Salah: //Hm?

Vika: //Ah. 

Ashley: So, my assumption is that zero for green zones or yellow zones means that it’s a good spot. 

00:42:22:00 – 00:43:55:05

[no audio]

Oleg: See how one two works for you.

Ashley: We’ll see. 

Katya: How did you even find this point, Oleg?

Vika: Well, how? By way of random choice.

Oleg: Well, the thing is that I think it is the most suitable one, in terms of the relief. 

Katya: Oh. Yes, very good.

Oleg: That is, the percentage of contamination I have is not high.

00:44:30:05

Vika: High level of water loss. 

Oleg: [SL] Then I will now…

Ashley: I wish the timestamps were showing when we send a chat message, so we knew how long it’s been. 

00:45:14:01

Vika: Because of what? Because of the size…

Oleg: So, we need to look…

Vika: with the size of…unlimited aquifer…and the size of restricted aquifer.

Oleg: Now, why are they saying that time is running out. There’s thirteen minutes left. 

00:46:00:00

-

00:46:28:26

Oleg: Three forty-eight. …It’s a bit deep, but I think it will do. 

Vika: Three forty-nine?

Oleg: Forty-right. 

00:47:08:11

Ashley: Not bad, but it will be more expensive because there will be many //dust storms. The climate is not great.

Salah: //[UI]

Vika: //Losses are the same as for the previous one. 

Oleg: So, the project is too expensive, yes?

00:47:33:14

Ashley: Make sure…

Will: It seems a little low. Three forty-nine is good for me, but for the structural geologist it would be too low. So, they will still need to respond about twenty-nine nineteen, and we will know. 

Oleg: Mhm. Yes, twenty-nine. Yes, in principle, it’s acceptable. 

00:48:07:27

Oleg: The biggest thing for me is that we don’t combine filters…One component only. Salah, what are your suggestions? Where do you like it?

Salah: [SL] Yes. 

00:48:45:13

Will: Okay. They say twenty-nine nineteen might work for them too.

Oleg: I think we should accept it. 

Will: Okay.

Oleg: Let’s accept, because now time is running out and we will just look for other more profitable options and will not find a better one.

Vika: Can we sign off? Sign off?

Will: //No, you need to write your things. 

Salah: //Oleg, can you check the eight…

Katya: Write your information. //Here I, for example, wrote drilling methods.

Ashley: //No, I think…

Salah: //forty-seven.

00:49:15:25

Oleg: Eight forty-seven? //I’ll tell you now. 

Katya: //Open your team…

Salah: Mechanical engineer said that it’s good. 

Oleg: Yes. Eight…//eight…I say it’s good.

Katya: //Here – see here? Sedimentology, geology. What is your team?

Oleg: But William said, //that it’s bad.

Vika: //Geologists. 

Salah: Will, no?

Will: What? //Which one?

Katya: //Hydrogeologist, yes?

Salah: You said about eight forty-seven?

Will: There is no water there. //I mean there is water, but it just loses it, so…It’s 100%. They said they are good with twenty nineteen. If twenty nineteen works, then…

Katya: //Are you a geologist?

Vika: //Yes.

Katya: //This one is yours.

Vika: //[UI]

Ashley: The only thing that my team said is that mechanical engineer from// his side, apparently, said that it’s doubtful because of the high temperatures there but we’ll just go with it.

Vika: //Oh, it’s everything. Looks like we are done. 

Katya: //That’s it from you, right?

Oleg: //Let’s choose twenty-nine nineteen and…

00:49:49:02

Will: They’ve set everything there. 

Oleg: Sign off?

Will: I say yes. 

Oleg: So, now…

Vika: Oleg, you did not sign off. 

Oleg: Sign off? Yes, I will sign off now. 

Vika: You too, Katya. Oh, I see. 

00:50:19:25

Ashley: So, give your data in Sign Off, but not…

Oleg: Yes, yes. 

Will: So…

Vika: So, can we?

Ashley: Don’t check it. 

Vika: okay.

Ashley: But enter your data. //Yeah, yeah. 

Katya: //We just…

Will: I didn’t even have to enter my data. It was already there. 

Vika: Yeah. 

Ashley: Let’s see…it needs to be that. Okay. 

00:50:58:00

Salah: For which point?

Ashley: Whatever is your…

Katya: Twenty-nine nineteen.

Ashley: [UI] if there is materials. 

Salah: Thank you. 

Ashley: So, you’ll have to put in drill brand, drill head, equipment material and equipment duty. 

Salah: Okay. 

00:51:39:10

Maybe Vika: [UI]

Vika: What?

Salah: This is…there is something. 

Vika: So cute! …For some reason, I even…mine turned off…

00:52:00:10

Vika: Why is there no video? Darn. [SL] It did not get recorded… 

Katya: Still going. 

00:52:30:16

Will: So…

Ashley: Looks like a lot of it is filled out. Let’s keep waiting a little bit. …so…Looks like…

Will: Only waiting…//biochemical. 

Ashley: We are only waiting for //your equipment duty and your last filter. 

00:52:59:05

Ashley: Do you…are you going to put that equipment duty in?

Salah: I put already. 

Ashley: It’s now showing up. 

Salah: Oh. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: Oh, okay. Somebody locked it. 

Katya: Biomechanic.

Ashley: Oh, did you give?

Katya: Oleg. 

00:53:30:00

Will: What?

Ashley: Uh-uh. 

Will: Why?

Ashley: We need to wait for everyone…I think that…Yeah. 

Will: Yeah, okay. 

Ashley: So, fluid engineer. Look, don’t give…

Will: Until everyone //has written there. 

Oleg: //Done.

Salah: Has been reset. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: This Stage One filter won’t…only for…yes?

Ashley: You won’t give Stage One filter?

Oleg: No. No. 

Will: Okay.

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: I can not put it. 

Ashley: Alright, so, now yes. Done.

Will: Yes, okay. Now…

Katya: Is that it? Everyone is giving it, as I can see. 

Oleg: Yes.

00:54:00:00

Katya: Fluid engineer, structural geologist. 

Ashley: Yes, that’s everything.

Will: Come on.

Oleg: Oh, so, //mine got reset. 

Katya: //Let’s roll.

Will: Now you added, we checked. Now we are ready.

Ashley: No. Your filters are still there. 

Oleg: Well, I…I am leaving them. 

Ashley: Yes.

Will: Yes. Okay. 

Katya: Well, can we?

Will: Yes.

Ashley: Yes, now we can. 

Katya: It’s written…

Salah: [SL] What’s up?

00:54:31:09

Katya: “All of the information is filled out”

Will: Got it. Done.

Katya: Is this okay? …Did you have the same?

Ashley: Katya, will you…

Vika: [UI]

Will: Yeah. Yes, and just sit back and relax. 

Vika: I already signed off. [SL] It’s out of it. 

Ashley: Where is…okay, there it is. 

Oleg: Alright. We are waiting for operations.

Vika: Okay. Operations. 

Ashley: I think that we got this, guys. 

Will: Hm?

Ashley: I said that we’re getting better at this. 

00:55:00:29

Vika: Yeah. 

Will: Oh…oh…

00:55:30:07

Salah: This time their communication is very bad. 

Will: Yeah. 

Salah: When we suggest some points //they say: “Temperature is high, okay”.

Will: //DeChurch nine.

Salah: //I am material specialist. We have some materials that are resistant to temperature. So, he doesn’t mention.

Will: //Do we turn off?

Ashley: //I think we just keep it going. 

Will: //Okay. So, keep going. So, in your other…So, open up the surveys. 

Ashley: Mhm.

Will: So, without exiting out. So, //you have to access through the…

Vika: //[UI]

Katya: Are we finishing already? So quickly.

Ashley: So, yeah. 

Will: Yeah. 

Vika: //I am not starting, perhaps, there will also be…

Ashley: DeChurch nine. Right away…

Katya: Are we turning off the camera?

Vika: No.

Oleg: No.

00:55:59:28

Katya: DeChurch nine right away, yes?

Will: Yes. //So, DeChurch nine. 

Oleg: //So, what? Logging out?

Ashley: Yes.

Will: But not turning off the camera. 

Oleg: So…DeChurch…Test 2B?

00:56:29:00

Ashley: Mhm. …2B. Yep. 

00:56:35:21 – 01:08:30:20

Oleg: Have you done Section Two already?

Katya: Hm?

Oleg: Have you done Section Two?

Katya: Yes. 

01:09:03:02

Salah: [SL] What’s next, Will?

Will: Now. Once we’re good with that, we will log in and do a…what do you call it? Project RED Relay. 

Salah: Hm?

Will: Project RED Relay. 

01:09:33:08

Will: Okay. 

Salah: Project RED…not Design. The other one. 

Will: Relay, yeah. 

Salah: Okay. 

Katya: Now we //RED Relay. 

Oleg: //Writing to each other?

Ashley: //Mhm.

Vika: Project RED Relay. 

Katya: Open another program, yes?

Ashley: Mhm.

Vika: Yes. On the desktop. 

Ashley: Throwing all notebooks onto the floor.

01:10:04:22

Oleg: What do you mean?

Vika: Throwing laptops down onto the floor. Putting them away [UI]

Oleg: Will we be testing memory or what?

01:10:33:21

Vika: Want me to add something else?

Oleg: Relay, yes? Relay?

Vika: On the desktop Relay.

Oleg: Project Relay. 

Vika: Mhm.

Ashley: Can you give me my chocolate? Please.

Oleg: It’s a prompt. 

Ashley: Thank you. 

Vika: Do you want something else?

Ashley: Only you. As we are recorded. 

Oleg: You can’t live without a stimulant, can you?

01:11:00:11

Ashley: I am just hungry. 

Олег: How hungry? You’ve been working. 

Salah: Waiting for other player to finish networking.

Oleg: Ash, do you know how everybody sees you?

Vika: Okay. [UI] Waiting for other players. 

Oleg: Yes?

Ashley: I don’t think everybody sees me like that. Only you. 

Oleg: Yes, of course. 

01:11:35:24

Oleg: Shall we select?

Ashley: Oh. I had a forbidden…I had an issue.

Oleg: Warned everyone not to.

Ashley: I had a verification failed. //It’s not good. 

Vika: //Uh-oh. 

Ashley: They did give a second link. So, if this didn’t work…Now it works. Okay. 

Oleg: Is it going for you?

Ashley: Yes. 

01:12:00:14

Oleg: Is everyone ready?

Will: Mhm. 

Oleg: So, well, shall we choose?

Will: Yeah. 

Oleg: Otherwise, Ashley will get too far ahead.

Will: Meaning?

Ashley: Well, that’s not so. //We can choose and this…

Katya: //[UI]

Will: //We can do it without her. So, like…

Ashley: Yes. You can choose already because //we will be this way, and this way... and this way and that way...

Will: //Yes.

Katya: We have all chosen already.

Will: It doesn’t start because everyone has //chosen. So that…

Ashley: //William, I don’t know how…

Oleg: So, are we continuing?

Will: Yes.

Ashley: But continue…

Will: It won’t let you go further.

Ashley: It won’t start anything.

Will: Yes. Without…

01:12:30:10

Katya: Without everyone. 

Ashley: So, you choose you role.

Oleg: Yes, yes. 

Ashley: Yes. And now you can choose two contacts too. And then we wait for all of them from Chicago too.

Will: Three more.

Ashley: Chicago. 

Vika: Mhm.

Ashley: Hi, Chicago. 

Vika: Hello! I was there once. There is a beautiful drop there.

01:13:01:01

Vika: I remember. 

Ashley: What was your disciplinary group?

Katya: Monument?

Will: [SL] Planetary…

Vika: Sculpture. 

Ashley: geology.

Will: geology. 

Ashley: Okay.

Will: Alright. And we are not talking.

Ashley: Yes. No talking at all. 

Will: We are not talking during this one. 

Vika: Can we laugh?

Will: Well, I guess we can. 

Vika: Well, okay. 

Oleg: Next?

Vika: We should wait. 

01:13:29:20

Vika: You choose…

Oleg: I chose. 

Vika: No.

Ashley: Chose two?

Oleg: Yes. 

Ashley: No. 

Oleg: What do you mean no?!

Ashley: Well, you do next. 

Oleg: Well, I am asking: “Next?”

Will: //Here, at last. Okay.

Salah: //Yes. Now okay. 

Oleg: Done…That’s why I am asking. 

Vika: Okay.

Oleg: I have, practically, out of twenty-five, only one did not get there. //The rest are all complete. 

Katya: //Wow.

Katya: What a good flow. 

Salah: Which survey?

Ashley: DeChurch ten. 

01:35:00:10
