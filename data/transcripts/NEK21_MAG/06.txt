2021A4  12:12  
Alright, I'm logged in.

2021A1  12:35  
Alright, so to start off are we just waiting for, so Samuel you're gonna find the locations and then just give us the locations that you find while you look for new ones?

2021A4  12:45  
Yep.

2021A1  12:47  
Okay cool. So I just sort of sit tight.

2021C1  13:26  
Okay, Martian Metrology says (7, 11) and (10, 30).

2021A4  13:42  
The geology team just sent me that as well.

2021A1  13:45  
Just putting that in the chat so that we have somewhere that it's written down in case someone forgets. (7, 11), (10, 30), got it.

2021C1  14:28  
Is Materials Specialist an MAG role?

2021A1  14:39  
Is anybody here the Materials Specialist?

2021C1  14:41  
No? Okay.

2021A1  14:43  
Okay I guess not.

2021A6  14:59  
Does anybody else have a problem with (7, 11)? Cause it's not great for me.

2021A1  15:08  
Just checking,  if anyone else forgets, I'll get back to you on that.

2021A2  15:10  
I'm putting in random values right now to just see what the total water output would be so I'll get back to you in like a second. What is usually the pump width? I don't know.

2021A4  15:30  
I need to re-login because I can't, I can't click on the grid cells. Like they won't populate this thing.

2021A5  15:38  
Same. Mine, they won't work for me, cause I'm putting in values and they won't create cells.

2021A4  15:43  
Yeah. I guess I'm just gonna try  re-logging in.

2021A2  16:31  
Does anyone, who is the Fluid Engineer?

2021A1  16:37  
That's me.

2021A2  16:38  
Oh. What is usually the pump width?

2021A1  16:43  
Do you mean the pipe width?

2021A2  16:44  
Yeah.

2021A1  16:47  
Like it depends on the soil type and the, sorry, the water conditions and soil conditions similarly. Are you asking about a specific point in particular?

2021A2  17:00  
Yeah, from now on, in order to get the total water output, I need to put in a value for that. So just like for (7, 11) and (10, 30), will you let me know what you do? And then I can see how much water that would.

2021A1  17:13  
Yep. Gotcha.

2021C1  17:18  
Lauren, you're Operations Specialist, right?

2021A6  17:24  
Yeah.

2021A4  17:24  
It said communication failure when I re-logged in.

It said communication failure, so I'm trying to log back in again.

Yes.

Joy, do you know if there's a communication delay even with our MAG group members? Cause I can try messaging them, it's.

Okay. Okay, I'm just gonna try messaging someone. Sam, I'll message you, and then just see if my message comes through.

2021A1  19:23  
Okay got it. Structural, Structural Geologist right?

2021A4  19:41  
Yeah.

2021A1  19:42  
I haven't gotten anything from you yet. Okay, yeah, yeah.

2021A4  19:48  
Did it go through?

2021A1  19:49  
Yeah, just did.

2021A4  19:56  
Yeah and I got your message.

I can message but I can't interact with the grid.

Yeah.

2021C1  21:02  
Interact with the grid or?

Yeah.

Sam, you need-? Oh, no, you go.

2021A1  21:31  
Oh, yeah, I was just gonna say, for the time being, with (7, 11), pipe width is what you wanted, right? I'd say probably somewhere in the middle. So around 40, just for the time being. Based on the temperature, mostly. Because it's, it's about mid temperature. So yeah. And the pipe type, I would probably say copper, for the time being, based on this soil type and terminants.

2021A2  22:17  
Yeah, for, wait you said (10, 11), I mean (7, 11) for that one?

2021A1  22:23  
Yeah.

2021A2  22:33  
And what material did you say?

2021A1  22:35  
Copper, I think. Copper seems to be the best fit.

2021A2  22:45  
And then I know Maura, you're the one that like knows how much wattage I can do for it being like. So what do you think, for (7, 11), would be like the highest amount?

2021A5  22:57  
How much usually did you say you have to do, I just know we're trying to keep the wattage and torque values as close together as possible. But you usually need, is it a high wattage value you usually need?

2021A2  23:09  
Yeah, the higher the better.

2021A5  23:11  
Okay, so what kind of wattage? I'll tell you if you tell me what the cost would be if you, what would you be looking at for wattage?

2021A2  23:20  
Let's try 200,000.

2021A5  23:33  
And, do you have any problem with how high the torque goes? Or? Like I know it can go up to 99,000 max, isn't it?

2021A2  23:42  
The torque? The highest it can go is, yeah, is 100,000.

2021A5  23:50  
Okay.

2021A2  23:56  
So if I did like 75,000 and 200,000, would that be not?

2021A5  24:02  
It's still expensive for me in this location. Like it's, it's not the worst option but it's like a poor option.

2021A2  24:10  
Yeah, even with that it wouldn't, it wouldn't have enough total water output it would have like 40,000 which is like not even, it's like half of what the worst option would be.

2021C1  24:19  
That's the survey.

2021A4  24:49  
I am on, it's called Brave, but it's, it's like a, it's built off of Chrome. So. I can try different browser right now. Just try Chrome.

2021A2  25:42  
Sam whenever you get the chance, for (10, 30), if you could tell me.

2021A1  25:47  
Yeah, I'll get on to that.

2021A2  25:49  
But yeah right now (7, 11), even if I did like 90,000 torque, it doesn't look great.

2021A1  25:59  
Okay.

2021A2  25:59  
Like for water output. So I would definitely just like cancel that.

2021A1  26:05  
Okay. For (10, 30), it's looking like pipe width 60 and PVC material is a good, good bet. Pretty good bet.

2021A2  28:16  
Okay, that looks like a lot better total. Wait, let me see something actually. I have to choose a random filters for now. Yeah that's like not even close, unfortunately.

2021A1  28:33  
Do we have any other locations at the moment?

2021A6  28:42  
Have you guys looked at (45, 47)?

2021A1  28:48  
No, should we? Wait the sign-off phase has begun?

So how long do we have?

Oh, okay.

2021A2  29:00  
45, what?

2021A3  29:11  
What was the, what was the suggestion?

2021A6  29:15  
(45, 47).

2021C1  29:22  
That works for me.

2021A1  30:10  
Okay, so PVC of 60 would be good for that one. the (45, 47). Do we have any others to look at in the time being?

2021A3  30:37  
I think that location is going to be prohibitively expensive for materials. It's like far higher than the worst option category.

2021A2  31:36  
To be clear, the only cells that we've tried so far are (7, 11), (10, 30), and (45, 47)?

2021A1  31:44  
That's correct, as far as I know. Does anyone have any other suggestions for the time being?

2021C1  31:54  
I was gonna say (47, 30).

2021A1  31:58  
Okay.

2021A6  32:14  
(47, 30) is pretty good for me.

2021C1  33:11  
Are there certain, like, areas of the map where your roles are kind of like, I guess, biased toward?

2021A3  33:24  
I think my materials costs are lower in the crater, the big one, just because there aren't, there's not really as much potential for like, ravines and stuff, as far as I've seen. I think (47, 30) is probably another dud, but I will get back to you.

2021C1  33:48  
Okay, how about like anybody else?

2021A6  33:51  
Yeah, like all of my spots that are good are in the upper right corner so far.

2021A2  34:03  
I'm usually, if the soil, I mean if the water is not that deep, then it's like, not going to pump enough water out. Like so far every one we've had has like really low water, so, no matter what, like materials you use, you can't get a lot of water out of it because it's like not, well, it's a good, high up area.

2021A3  34:25  
That one is almost as expensive. Still in the lowest category.

2021A1  34:30  
Alright, so which one are we on to now? We're scrapping (45, 47), right> So which one are you guys looking at now? What was that?

2021C1  34:57  
Did you already look at, you already looked at (47, 30) right?

2021A1  34:59  
Oh no I didn't, because I thought you said that it wasn't very good.

2021C1  35:04  
Oh John just said that. Okay.

2021A2  35:29  
Is there anywhere where you can try in like the blue area where there's a lot of water? Because I feel like that would be the most ideal, ideal for a well. Like where there's in between land and water.

2021A6  35:40  
Oh they just said (19, 29). I don't know where that is but it's another place to look at.

2021A1  35:48  
It looks like it's in the water. Yeah, that's around about the water area.

2021A3  36:43  
That one works for me really well, even with a pretty high repair frequency.

2021A1  37:05  
Okay, problem with that is I think the areas where it's a really high temperature, like it doesn't actually have an effect on the results, but at least, the thing that it tells me in my role is that like a smaller pipe width is preferred when the temperature is really high. So basically all of the high temperature places aren't great because you're supposed to go with like a small pipe width even though the restriction is less if you still set a wide pipe width. So I don't know if we want to try and go for one with, at a lower temperature or we can just, I don't know, just still go with a wider pipe even though it's really hot.

2021A5  37:47  
Yeah this area for me, it's my worst option, cost-wise.

2021A1  37:51  
1900.

2021A3  38:00  
By the way, did we give up on (7, 11) and (10, 30)? Or are we still working on those?

2021A1  38:05  
I think we did.

2021A2  38:05  
Yeah there was no water output there.

2021A3  38:08  
Okay. All right.

2021A4  38:48  
Hey, Josh, I'm telling all the people who are messaging me right now to message you. Okay? Just be aware of that.

2021C1  39:01  
For like depth of UCI, stuff like that?

2021A4  39:05  
Yeah.

2021C1  39:18  
Am I geology?

Did we give up on, which did we call it, (47, 30)?

2021A6  40:25  
I think so.

2021A3  40:26  
Yeah, it was just too inaccessible, we couldn't repair it at all.

2021A1  40:30  
Okay.

2021A2  40:32  
I know this isn't my, like, job, so I don't know what like the other factors are, but did someone try like (24, 35) or any of the ones that are like along the coast that are deep but close to land so it might be less expensive? Like I would try ones like that.

2021A3  40:54  
I think (24, 35) works if it were to look into that one.

2021A1  41:13  
Yeah I was just looking at (25, 36) and that general area looks pretty good.

2021C1  41:26  
Lauren, you have, you can put in stuff for Drilling Specialist and Materials Specialist, right?

2021A6  41:37  
Yeah.

2021C1  41:37  
Or like, the calculations?

2021A6  41:38  
Yeah.

2021C1  41:39  
For pretty much anything in the crater, power auger is like the only option.

2021A6  41:47  
Okay, oh wait wait, hold on. Yeah. Okay.

2021A2  42:10  
Yeah, any of the ones near the coast, like (24, 35), (25, 36) are fine for me depending on like wattage and torque that like I can't really do until I know about price yet. But like, generally, I think we could work them out. So those are fine by me.

2021A5  42:33  
Yeah I just checked (24, 35) and that's within my costs. I'll check the other one now.

2021A1  43:03  
Wow, that went by quick.

2021C1  44:38  
Oh wait, did (24, 35) come from them or us? And do they know?

2021A2  44:43  
Us.

2021A1  44:43  
I think from us. I think from us.

2021A2  46:13  
Has anyone communicated with them the two new points?

2021A1  46:26  
No.

2021C1  46:28  
I only told them (24, 35).

2021A3  46:30  
I just told them (24, 36).

2021A1  46:33  
(24, 35) is looking decent to me, the only thing about it is, with the temperature, you're not supposed to have a really high pipe width. But if we don't, then the restriction will be too high. But um, if we just say screw it and go with a high pipe width even though, like disregarding temperature, temperature, then we get a good pipe restriction, which is 0.35. Which is like on a scale of zero to one. It's like zero is no restriction. That's like the best score we've gotten so far.

2021A2  47:14  
I just.

2021A1  47:14  
What does everyone else's?

2021A2  47:15  
Well, right now I can't add any more grid cells. Like it just stopped working for me, I think. Oh, wait, maybe if I delete some? Yeah, okay, nevermind.

2021A1  47:28  
What does everyone else think about (24, 35)?

2021A2  47:30  
I can make it work.

2021C1  47:34  
It work for me.

2021A3  47:35  
Yeah, it's a solid option.

2021A2  47:38  
Wanna go with that like C or?

2021A6  47:43  
It's pretty bad. But like, I think honestly, like, every point is gonna be pretty bad unless it's like in this tiny cluster. So like, it's fine.

2021A1  47:52  
Yeah, the thing is, it's just like, with every point, there's going to be at least one thing that doesn't line up perfectly, I think. Or at least, to some extent, like you're not, you're not going to find the perfect point for every one.

2021A6  48:03  
Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.

2021A1  48:06  
Okay if we don't find a better one, are we happy to go with (24, 35)?

2021A2  48:10  
Yeah

2021A3  48:11  
Yep.

2021A1  48:13  
Okay.

2021A2  48:24  
Oh, what did you say for the pipe material and width for that one was?

2021A1  48:29  
I believe I said, PVC of 60. Even though that's not, not entirely ideal, based on the temperature, but for the pipe restriction it's the best option.

2021A5  48:48  
Sorry, can you just repeat what you said about those locations, my Internet just cut out. And I heard nothing from the last like three minutes I'd say.

2021A1  48:56  
I don't think there was anything too important. Maybe not for your role, I don't think. We were just saying. Like I was just saying PVC of 60 probably for (24, 35). Oh, yeah, we were thinking about going with (24, 35), I don't know if you heard that. But we're just saying if we don't find a better one, we'll go with that. If it works for everybody. Does it work for you?

2021A5  49:25  
Yeah that's within my cost.

2021A1  49:28  
Okay.

2021A5  49:28  
It would be like a fair option.

2021A2  49:31  
Okay, so then from that we need to figure out like the wattage and torque because now that I have the pipe width and material, it produces a lot less than like, what my estimation was. So what is like the highest wattage for price you think that I can do?

2021A1  49:46  
Are you asking me?

2021A2  49:51  
Maura.

2021A5  49:53  
What value would you be thinking of?

2021A2  49:57  
I mean, the highest is 500,000 I'm pretty sure. Wait no. Yeah the highest is 500,000, so, the highest.

2021A5  50:18  
Okay if you did 500, then I'd have to try and bring this one up. I'll see what it does to the price. Oops. Okay, that's just in, if I was to do that, that would be just within the range but I'd have to bring the torque up to, wait. This keeps disconnecting. I have to bring it up to 99,000.

2021A2  50:45  
Yeah, that's like not even.

2021A1  50:49  
Do you want to try, Briana, do you want to try with copper instead? That might work as well. I don't know if that's better than that.

2021A2  50:55  
Yeah, it doesn't make a difference. I'm gonna try that now.

2021A1  50:57  
Okay.

2021A2  50:59  
Could you possibly bring the pipe width down?

2021A1  51:04  
Yeah, it'll raise the restriction but that might be good actually.

2021A2  51:07  
Yeah like, it's not even close. Like it's, it's way below worst range of 60, so it's like.

2021A1  51:14  
Okay, how about probably the lowest I want to go because like 40 gives a restriction of 0.57 which is reasonably high but if you really need it to be lower. Like can you try?

2021A2  51:25  
Yeah 40, it's in the poor option but at least it's above worst. So that's like fine. I mean, obviously not great, but.

2021C1  51:39  
They said, their Materials Specialist said, is that a new message? (13, 38)? Or no?

2021A3  51:50  
I just got that, yeah.

That one's doable for me. It's not as good, but it's alright.

2021A2  52:48  
I feel like we should choose between these two, start putting stuff in.

2021A1  53:07  
Sorry, what was that?

2021A2  53:09  
I think we should choose between the two and start putting stuff in because we only have five minutes so we have to start.

2021A1  53:13  
Do we wanna use, one of them is, so what are the two that you're talking about? (24, 35), and?

2021A2  53:21  
It was, yeah.

2021A1  53:24  
What was the other one?

2021A2  53:26  
(13, 38). They just said that in the chat, I don't know.

2021A1  54:01  
Personally, I prefer (24, 35). Neither of them are good in terms of temperature, but (24, 35) is the better one of the two for me.

2021A3  54:10  
Apparently the Sedimentologist is saying there's no water at (24, 35) or (24, 36).

2021A1  54:16  
Wait what? How is that making sense? The water depth is like super high.

2021A2  54:21  
Yeah.

2021A1  54:25  
What does he mean there's no water?

2021A2  54:26  
He might mean there's like no water output, but based on the other ones, it's poor, but it's better than worst. Like that's, all the options are pretty bad with water output, but that might be what he means, like water output.

2021C1  54:42  
Did we already looked at (39, 41)?

2021A1  54:44  
I don't think so.

2021A6  54:49  
I don't think so.

2021A1  54:49  
Did you say (39, 41)?

2021C1  54:51  
Yeah.

2021A2  54:56  
That's definitely, we'll see.

2021A1  54:58  
I mean that's better than (13, 38).

2021A6  55:03  
Yeah it's like decent.

2021A2  55:23  
Yeah, that's fine too. We just need to start, like we need to start just putting one in. So I think we can just choose which one works better for us and then I hope they'll have to make it work during the sign-off.

2021A3  55:41  
Yeah, I don't think (39, 41) is going to be very good.

2021A1  55:46  
Why is that?

2021A3  55:48  
It just has a lot of obstacles to it's ability.

2021A1  55:55  
Okay.

2021A3  55:55  
So my costs are pretty through the roof. I'm in the worst option.

2021A1  56:16  
Well, yeah (39, 41) is not bad for me, but we get a better level of restriction with (24, 35). That's my, that's my vote, I think. What's everyone thinking?

2021A3  56:37  
Yeah, I mean (24, 35) looks fine to me. Unless the Sedimentologist has a particular reason.

2021A1  56:43  
Yeah, who, who's communicating with him? Do you want to just ask, should we clear up what he means by there's no water?

2021C1  56:51  
Or, that was the Materials Specialist. They said all the points you mentioned above, there's no water there.

That's, that's an issue.

2021A1  57:14  
A minute left, I think we're gonna have to just go with it.

2021A6  57:18  
With (24, 35)?

2021A1  57:21  
At (24, 35). I don't know what he means by there's no water there but.

2021C1  57:24  
Maybe, maybe he was referring to what Lauren sent with the (45, 47) area, or something like that.

2021A1  57:33  
Maybe, yeah.

2021A2  57:34  
Yeah guys I would just start putting stuff in and then they can change it for what they have but we don't really have time to do new points right now.

2021A3  57:41  
Okay.

2021A2  57:41  
We gotta put values in.

2021A3  57:55  
Do we have a wattage and torque?

2021A5  58:15  
For the last location.

2021A2  58:16  
Did someone put it in the map cell?

2021A5  58:17  
It just keeps coming up with errors.

2021C1  58:31  
Wait who's, who puts in the map cell typically? Is that one of the geology?

Yikes.

2021A1  58:54  
So just do a final check we're doing (24, 35), yeah?

2021A3  58:58  
Yeah.

2021A1  59:00  
Okay. Has anyone here not chucked their details in?

2021A3  59:35  
I just need to put in my decisions, but.

2021A2  59:36  
I still don't see the right coordinate. It says (-1, -1).

2021C1  59:46  
Yeah, the rest of the planetary geology is in Moscow so.

2021A2  59:57  
So do they know the coordinate?

2021C1  1:00:03  
Let me send it. What did we say about (13, 38)? No?

2021A1  1:00:47  
I don't know. I don't know, let me double check.

2021A6  1:00:51  
I think people were saying that it was like fine but less good.

2021A1  1:01:01  
Okay, for me it's got like an average water depth, reasonably high contaminants and high temperature, so it's not great, but like, if you want to, if you really want to go with it because it's perfect for your role then I don't really mind my one isn't as important.

2021C1  1:01:20  
Alright so, let me just send.

Yeah.

A no from the, a no from the Meteorologist and Hydrologist but the Sedimentologist is on board. Moscow is not budging on (24, 35).

2021A1  1:03:16  
Not budging as in they don't like it?

2021A3  1:03:18  
They don't like it.

2021A1  1:03:20  
Well, do you want to ask them what their suggestion actually is? Because we kinda need to.

2021C1  1:03:26  
They, we kind of just have to go with (13, 38) I think.

2021A1  1:03:29  
Really?

2021C1  1:03:31  
Yeah. They, they seem kind of adamant on that.

2021A1  1:03:39  
Alright. I'm still going to stick with the same PVC of 50. It's still the best move.

2021A3  1:04:29  
Yeah, I mean it works for me. That's fine. Wait you said 50 PVC?

2021A2  1:04:44  
50 for width. I would not do anything with the width more than 40 or else there's not going to be any water coming out.

2021A1  1:04:52  
Why do you say that?

2021A2  1:04:54  
Because everything over 50 becomes like worst option.

2021A1  1:04:58  
Really?

2021A2  1:04:59  
Like 40 is kind of the, I would, I would say 40 is probably the best.

2021A1  1:05:03  
Well 40 then. Are you sure? Because it says the pipe restriction is way worse when I put it down to 40.

2021A2  1:05:16  
I mean that's just affecting the total water output but I mean there's not enough time for me to like re-put all the values in and see, but you can try and see if the water output, if the water output is below 60 then it's worst option, so definitely make sure it's. I just can't see what the, what it is until they put in the coordinate so I don't know yet.

2021C1  1:05:38  
Sending messages into the void. I'm just going to tell them we can make (13, 38) work.

2021A1  1:06:06  
We don't click until everybody's put their thing in, right? You don't click the tick box until everyone's done?

2021A3  1:06:13  
I'm good.

2021C1  1:07:19  
What are you on about? The Materials Specialist just keep saying there's no water at (24, 35).

2021A6  1:07:32  
Do they know that we're like, yeah.

2021C1  1:07:38  
That point doesn't work for us. Whomst did I, okay. Into the system, we can't see them in the sign off just yet. Don't tell me it's a specifically Structural Geologist thing.

2021A4  1:08:14  
I'm pretty sure that the other.

2021A2  1:08:22  
It also doesn't matter right now because the time is up so we have to just put information.

2021A4  1:08:29  
I'm pretty sure the other geology members can put in values.

2021C1  1:08:39  
I don't know what I'll do about my calculation numbers, but. I'm just curious but I'm going to see if I can sign off on it and then someone could just reject it immediately, but.Oh, you signed off.

2021A4  1:09:22  
Yeah, that's weird. Okay, it seems like I can do literally everything else but interact with the map, so.

Yeah.

2021C1  1:10:12  
Hydro, chill. They haven't put their stuff in, have they?

2021A4  1:11:00  
I just messaged them saying that they have to, but I, because I think I'm always, I've always been the one who's putting in the location, so I'm not sure if they know how to do it.

2021C1  1:11:16  
Materials Specialist has said (13, 38) and sign off. Okay so they, they know. Alright, I think, I think we're getting some stuff from them now. Biochemical Engineer has signed off. Please don't. Is this, is this the Sedimentologist who's just? Yeah boy. Alright, that's. It's not possible to just like type in (13, 38) for map cell right?

2021A4  1:14:15  
No. I think to put the map cell values in, I think you have to drag and drop from your calculations tab.

2021C1  1:14:20  
Okay. Oh. Oh what is? You cannot update the shared decision calculator with a different map so only the geology team can update the map cell. Oh, okay. So it's dragging from calculations on to it right?

2021A4  1:15:01  
Yeah, yeah.

2021C1  1:15:02  
Okay and they don't know that?

2021A4  1:15:05  
I messaged them, but. Here, could we just have like the geology team put in the stuff?

2021C1  1:15:47  
We're trying but it doesn't look like we can didn't think we had the option. Just try with whatever calculation. We're trying but it doesn't look like we can, we've never done it before, didn't even think we had the option. Sam, can you, like manually input grid cells? No? Okay.

2021A4  1:16:31  
I can't, I can't put it in because I can't access any of the grid cell information. Oh there you go, they got it in.

2021A1  1:16:46  
Yes there we go. Finally.

2021A4  1:16:58  
Okay, I think everyone is good for now.

2021A2  1:17:11  
Is that the last of information that needs to be put in?

2021A4  1:17:14  
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

2021A1  1:18:04  
For some reason it's not letting me, not letting me confirm. Every time I click yes, it just goes back out to the screen and the box isn't ticked. Oh, there we go, it was just the delay. Okay. Oh what the? Oh wait, someone kicked me out?

2021C1  1:18:37  
Maura, did you sign off?

2021A5  1:18:41  
No, I'm not able to sign off. It kind of logged me out of the whole thing, and I'm trying to look back at my credentials to log back in and it won't let me log in.

2021C1  1:18:49  
Oh.

2021A5  1:18:49  
So I don't know what to do.

2021A1  1:18:51  
Just be patient with it. I had to try a couple of times in mine.

2021A5  1:19:01  
Yeah, it's saying like, could not log in with credentials or something. And I put it in and out a few times. Like I'm off the whole website because halfway through it kept saying error messages. So I just started, I couldn't like even input values, I would just going like the arrow button to go like up at the end of the session and then it just kind of logged me out completely it said communication error and just kind of. Like I'm not even looking at the thing,

I was getting that but I could keep X-ing out of it. It would come every few seconds, but now I'm like not even on the website.

2021A4  1:20:09  
Yes. Yeah we can see everything.

2021A1  1:20:32  
By the way Maura, what browser are you using?

2021A5  1:20:35  
I was using Google. It just keeps changing.

2021A1  1:20:38  
Google Chrome?

2021A5  1:20:39  
 Yeah.

2021A1  1:20:40  
Okay.

2021A4  1:21:22  
Aw, the Sedimentologist said, y'all did a great job today. Please pass on our thanks to your team. Y'all are really amazing and doing great work. Thank you for working with us.

2021A2  1:21:32  
So wholesome,

2021A1  1:21:35  
Yay. Good job everybody. We did it. Oh, actually we're not done yet, but still.

2021C1  1:21:43  
The Sedimentologist, I just got let's go. That's about, yeah.

2021A4  1:21:51  
I got that one before as well. I also got you're an absolute king in capital letters.

I don't think they know that.

2021A1  1:22:38  
Whoever's been in contact with them, do you want to just shoot them a message saying that? Because they'll be checking those messages from.

Yeah.

Yep.

You need quite a few screenshots.

2021C1  1:23:02  
Y'all did a great job today, thank you. Looking forward to hearing from you.

2021A1  1:23:11  
Do you need screenshots of the signoff activity log, or just the details?

Okay.
