Ashley: Okay.

Will: Reopen it now. We do this the same. These guys are working with us, a huge team.

Salah: Okay.

Will: I’ve already sent one. They haven’t asked for assistance, [UI].

Ashley: All right. Well, I put my camera on. What about everyone else?

Will: Okay.

Ashley: Yeah.

Vika: I’m ready.

Will: Camera.

Ashley: All right. Audio is on. 

00:00:30:22

Vika: You have a questionnaire...

Oleg: Do you have it?

Will: Yes.

Ashley: Today’s mission... 96, right? All right. 
              Today is February 8th, 2022. It is mission day 96. Time is 3:24 pm. Three, two, one...

Ashley, Will, Vika, Oleg, Salah: Mark.

00:00:58:05 – 00:01:25:22

[no audio]

Ashley: It doesn’t work, does it?

00:01:29:18

Oleg: Well, I... uh, the points are actually being marked.

00:01:46:10

Ashley: 33-10.

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: It’s not bad.

00:01:48:19 – 00:03:01:04

[no audio]

Oleg: It is still not being marked.

Ashley: It is strange that all this...

Oleg: // Oh, that’s it?

Ashley: // It’s you who has an issue! Ha-ha.

Oleg: // Here we go again.

Vika: // Ha-ha.

Oleg: Whatcha gonna do? Maybe we should switch our computers.

Ashley: We could.

Vika: You will then have to contact everybody and bother them – ha-ha – in our chat room.

Oleg: Please check 30-35.

Will: Just a moment.

00:04:01:02

Ashley: I like it.

Oleg: Huh?

Vika: It’s okay. Will you be able to purify it?

Oleg: Yes, this is actually what I...

Vika: It’s okay then.

Ashley: Is there water? Ha-ha.

Will: Just a moment.

Vika: There is water.

00:04:14:08 – 00:04:23:01

[no audio]

Oleg: So, an overall loss is 10%. For the purification.

Vika: Which one is it?

Will: Okay, what point is it? Yes…

Vika: 30-35.

Will: 30-35. Just a second.

00:04:37:04 – 00:04:50:01

[no audio]

Will: There is water, it’s not bad.

Ashley: Mmm. Wow!

Oleg: That’s what I’m saying, it’s just my computer didn’t work before.

Salah: Which number?

Ashley: 30-35. Seems to work for all of us. Ha-ha. So, now we are waiting to see if it’s too deep.

Oleg: The only thing is that the depth is 1200.

Salah: Okay.

Oleg: // Yes? 

Ashley: Ho-ho! Everybody agreed. // Wow!

Vika: // Oh! No way.

Ashley: And what do you think about 33-10? Ha-ha.

Vika: Ha-ha.

Will: So, did everyone agree on 30-35?

Oleg: Uh-huh.

Vika: Yes.

Oleg: For me, it’s very… 10% from me, it’s just…

Will: Okay.

00:05:33:11

Will: Which one is it?

Ashley: 33...

Vika: // 33-10. 

Ashley: //... 10.

Vika: Uh-uh.

Ashley: Okay. // Ha-ha.

Oleg: // Ha-ha.

Vika: Sorry.

Ashely: All right.

00:06:01:23

Ashley: Usually there is a problem with mine, because each time there is a little bit…

Oleg: Does it spill?

Ashley: Yes, but a little bit, only when it’s full. I don’t know.

Will: What point is it?

Salah: Vika gonna help you.

Vika: // 33-10.

Salah: // Your chocolate? My chocolate?

Will: Which one?

Vika: 33-10.

Salah: And // [UI].

00:06:27:25

Ashley: // But you said that... you said that 33-10 wasn’t good, right?

Will: // There is no water.

Vika: Uh-uh.

Ashley: Okay.

Oleg: There is no water, except this one.

Ashley: What?

Oleg: There is no water, ha-ha, definitively…

Ashley: The water is only here on me, ha-ha.

Oleg: No, on you, ha-ha.

Vika: That’s where the water is!

Ashley: Water, compote [dried fruit drink], ha-ha!

Vika: What else? “Babushkino Lukoshko” [“Grandmother’s Basket” – the brand name of Russian food products, mainly puree] ?

Ashley: Probably, also there. Ha-ha.

Will: There it is.

Ashley: This is probably yesterday’s makeup, ha-ha!

00:07:00:24

Ashley: So much stuff in just one day, ha-ha.

Oleg: So, you are a real collector.

Ashley: Within one day. What?

Oleg: A collector.

Ashley: Ho-ho! What about 20-39!

Will: No.

00:07:30:00

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Oleg: Ha-ha. Just one word – no, // and that’s it.

Salah: // No from me also. Also no.

Vika: No, sorry, Ash.

Ashley: I give up. Just kidding. Ha-ha. Ho-ho. What about... ha-ha... 2-39? That is a huge population reached and very high accessibility.

00:08:00:28 

Vika: 2-39. 30 or 40?

Ashley: Yeah. 39, yeah.

Vika: 39, okay.

Will: 2-39, right?

Ashley: Uh-huh.

Vika: No, sorry.

Will: No, no water.

Ashley: Damn it. [whispering] Ha-ha.

Vika: Nice try, Ash. Ha-ha.

00:08:29:00

Salah: Last time, which one did we agree? Remember, guys?

Will: Hmm.

Vika: 30-35.

Ashley: Last time?

Salah: Last time.

Vika: Yeah, I think so.

Salah: It was 28, I think, or 32.

Will: We had 22-32. We had 38-14.

Salah: Yeah, think this one, yeah? 38?

Will: 14.

Ashley: Do they randomize them each time... you think?

Will: I’m sure they do, yeah.

Ashley: It’s not the same.

Will: That can’t be. But take a look and see.

Salah: Yeah.

00:09:00:00 

Vika: 14. 14? 38-14?

Will: What it was... it was 38-14. But it... it was last time.

00:09:13:00 – 00:09:45:05

[no audio] 

Salah: Check 28-32.

00:10:01:24

Will: Hmm. It’s... only get 9% of water out of there.

Vika: Hmm. High... high level of contamination.

Salah: Hmm.

Vika: Hmm, for...

Will: And I don’t like the way it looks.

Vika: // 49...

Ashley: // And it’s boring.

Vika: //... 46.

Salah: // Yeah. 

Will: So boring.

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Vika: Guys? Please.

Ashley: Sorry, ha-ha.

Vika: For this, 49-46.

Ashley: 49-46.

00:10:32:10

Salah: Where did you jump? After the [UI].

Will: What... what number?

Vika: 49-46. Oleg, please take a look and see if you could deal with...

Oleg: 49?

Vika: 49-46. Could you deal with... the contamination? 

Oleg: Not bad.

Salah: Okay for me.

Ashley: There could only be 500 people here, a very small population reached.

Vika: Ha-ha.

Ashley: Ha-ha.

00:11:06:05

Ashley: Yeah, this is potentially the worst option. Ha-ha.

Vika: The worst?

Ashley: I mean...

Vika: For you, for you.

Ashley: For me, for me, ha-ha.

Vika: For you. Excuse me.

00:11:31:00

Oleg: Ah, there will be heavy losses. 

Vika: Really? Okay.

Oleg: Well, if I replace now...

Vika: I... it’s still bad for me, so it’s not necessary.

Will: Which one?

Vika: It’s the previous point.

Will: I... mine are all like this.

00:11:53:00 – 00:12:55:13

[no audio]

Vika: Guys! 36-29. 36-29.

00:13:05:23

Will: 36-29, right? 36-29?

Vika:  Yes, yes.

Salah: For me okay.

Will: // One hundred percent water loss.

Ashley: // The worst option for me also for population. Ha-ha.

Salah: // Huh?

Will: One hundred... one hundred percent water loss.

Ashley: Okay. I don’t feel so bad then.

00:13:26:00 – 00:14:32:00

[no audio]

Salah: [UI]

Oleg: 28-23.

Will: 28-23. A small amount of water, but it is there.

Ashley: Not the best for me either.

Oleg: It looks very clean.

Vika: It’s okay for me.

00:15:00:00

Oleg: Very clean.

Vika: Which one did we choose? 30-32?

Oleg: No, 30-35.

Vika: 30-35. I deleted by mistake. Thank you!

Ashley: How about 12-46?

Vika: In slow motion.

Oleg: Why are you asking so carefully?

Vika: 12-46. Ha-ha.

00:15:30:11

Ashley: Wh… What? Ha-ha.

Vika: No, sorry.

Will: Which one?

Vika: 12-46. 

Salah: Sorry.

Vika: Ha-ha.

Will: There is literally no water there.

Salah: Ha-ha.

Vika: That’s what I said.

Ashley: Ho-ho.

Salah: We go with the buzz for “America Got Talent.”

Ashley: // But. 14-17.

Vika: Okay. 

00:15:58:22

Will: 14-17. Water nowhere.

Salah: Check 30-16.

Vika: Just a sec.

Salah: 30-16.

Vika: For me, it’s... it’s not good also.

Will: // Is it... what are we looking for?

Salah: 30-16.

Ashley: // Okay, let me try.

Vika: // Hmm. 30...

Will: No water.

Vika: 16.

00:16:32:25

Oleg: 40.

Vika: 30.

Will: Uh-huh.

Vika: Hmm. Not good for me also.

Will: Boo.

00:16:59:00

Vika: [sigh] Hmm. Guys, could you check please 16-20?

Ashley: Oh, I like it!

Vika: It is 20, uh, 12. I wanted to say.

Oleg: 28-16.

Salah: 16-20.

00:17:30:21

Vika: 16, uh, 16-20 it looks like.

Salah: // 16-20, it’s good for me.

Ashley: 16-20 is good for me, too.

Vika: // Or really? I will check, I will check.

Ashley: Yeah, ha-ha.

Will: Yeah.

Vika: 16-12?

Ashley: Wait. You said 20, right?	

Vika: Oh, 20, 20, yeah. But I can check...

Ashley: // But you meant, yeah.

Vika: … 16-12. 

Ashley: Okay, I will check.

Oleg: Check 28-16.

Vika: Hold on, hold on, just a second. No, sorry, 16... uh, 20 is not good.

Ashley: All right, let me check 16-12 then. And… oh, 16-12 is also possible.

Oleg: 28-16.

Will: 16-20.

Ashley: No, no. 

00:18:00:13

Vika: 16-12.

Ashley: Which one did you say?

Oleg: 28-16.

Ashley: 28...

Oleg: 16.

Ashley: 16.

Salah: Uh-huh. Deep.

Will: 16-12.

Vika: 16-12.

Ashley: 16-12 is better than yours for me.

Vika: Uh, 28-16 is not good, Oleg.

Will: Hmm. A small amount of water. 85% water loss.

Vika: Hmm.

Ashley: Okay.

Vika: This is 16-12.

Will: Yes.

00:18:45:26

Ashley: Ah! 11-13. Ha-ha.

Vika: 11-13?

Ashley: Uh-huh.

Vika: Just a sec.

00:19:00:20

Will: Crap.

Vika: It’s okay. But uh, it’s...

Will: // A small amount of water.

Vika: // ... high, high, high level of contamination.

Salah: // Too deep.

Will: // 77%.

Salah: // Too deep.

Oleg: // 60% loss.

Ashley: [sigh] Okay.

Will: 77% loss.

Ashley: Um, okay.
Vika: Sorry, Ash.

Ashley: Okay, okay.

Vika: It was a nice try.

Oleg: Too dirty.

Ashley: // Crap!

Vika: // Boo!

Ashley: Such a good...

Oleg: Too muddy. Somebody stirred it up, mixed it up.

00:19:29:14

Ashley: Hmm. Ha-ha.

Salah: 30-21.

Ashley: Let’s see [whispering].

Will: 30 you said?

Salah: Yeah, 21.

Ashley: It’s 50% okay for me.

Vika: Uh, it’s okay.

Will: // That’s, man, really good. It’s a lot of water.

Ashley: // Ah, that’s the case.

Will: // It’s a lot of water.

Vika: // Uh, Oleg, will you be able to purify 30-21?

00:20:01:22

Oleg: Let’s see. 

Will: It’s a lot of water there.

Ashley: Ho-ho.

Vika: Guys, what do you think about 6-21?

Oleg: Let’s see, [UI]. So, yes, it’s possible to purify this, but with a 60% loss, up to 60%.

Will: It still will be a lot of water.

00:20:29:20

Oleg: Yes, but then…

Will: Even if it’s 50%, it would remain the same as in other points.

Oleg: Let’s leave it then.

Ashley: Okay. So, Salah’s point is really good for everybody, right?

Vika: 30-21, yes.

Ashley: And then, for the point you’ve mentioned, 6-21...

Vika: 6-21.

Ashley: Overall, it’s not bad, but it will be more expensive than others. But I like it. Ha-ha.

Salah: What’s the point? 6?

Vika: 6-21.

Ashley: 6-21.

Will:  Which one? What?

00:21:00:27

Vika: 6-21.

Will: Have you already checked, haven’t you?

Vika: No.

Salah: Okay.

Will: Just a moment.

Ashley: All right, my team responded. Which ones will we suggest?

Will: // 6.

Vika: // 20.

Will: I have already suggested 30-35.

Vika: // 35. 30-21 probably.

Will: //49-46.

Ashley: Wait, 49-46?

00:21:30:16

Will: Yes, but these are kind of low. But actually it’s fine. 

Ashley: // I need to check that one.

Will: 49-46 and 30-21. I will check 6-21 now. 6-21 is not bad.

Ashley: Okay. So...

Will: // 6-21 was okay.

Ashley: I will suggest to my team 30-35. 49-46 you said?

Will: Yeah.

Vika: Uh-huh.

Ashley: 39-21 and 6-21.

Will: That’s good to me.

00:22:04:00

Vika: You said 39?

Salah: // 39 you said?

Ashley: 39.

Salah: No.

Ashley: // No, 30, 30, 30. 30-21. Thanks.

Vika: // No, 30, 30-21. Yeah.

Salah: Because I was looking.

Ashley: Thank you.

Will: Boo.

Vika: Very well.

00:22:29:04

Oleg: I can’t work anymore for some reason today. Oh, they woke up.

Vika: This is Yasha. 

Oleg: No.

Vika: Hundred percent. No. Ha-ha.

Ashley: What? You don’t like my messages?

Vika: I love it. Especially at night or during the evening. Ha-ha.

Ashley: I haven’t been typing at night. 

Vika: I’m joking, joking. 

Will: Who responded to you?

00:22:59:00

Ashley: Uh, my, my, my team maintenance specialist and Martian terrain specialist. They said, “Structural geologist just is running late on our end today.”

Will: Oh, damn!

Ashley: But they said...

Will: Why, why, why is my boy late?

Ashley: Ha-ha. He wanted to sleep in, man, so. Ha-ha.

Will: Not struct geo. Where are you at?

Ashley: Boy!

Will: Oy!

Ashley: Ha-ha. I do wonder if it’s a boy or girl, actually.

00:23:30:15

Will: I think it’s a boy. I mean, I talked to them before.

Ashley: Yeah. Mine’s like, Martian terrain specialist. “Let’s go, gang. Let’s do this.” I’m like, “All right.” Ha-ha.

Will: I’ve already informed drilling specialist, structural geologist, and operation specialist about offered ones that we’re suggesting, So, you’ve got your team on a roll, on board.

00:23:56:00 – 00:24:53:03

[no audio]

Oleg: How about 20-16?

Vika: Wonderful.

Will: Um, a very small amount of water.

Ashley: This is the mechanical engineer. Did somebody suggest 30-45 to them? 

Will: I might have.

Salah: // 30-45?

Vika: // For me, [UI]

00:25:29:00

Ashley: // Because they said 30-45 was the best option for us so far.

Will: // Uh, that’s not the one that we suggested.

Ashley: // That’s not the one... we didn’t suggest that one.

Salah: // We didn’t suggest it.

Will: Right, okay.

Ashley: Let’s check it, I guess.

Vika: Uh, it was good, 30-35?

Ashley: But, but he mentioned 45.

Will: 30-45 // was...

Vika: Ah, // 45.

Ashley: I mean, it’s okay. Let me make sure they got 30-21, I think so.

00:26:03:25

Oleg: So, 49-46?

Salah: [sigh]

Will: // 49. Which one?

Oleg: // 49-46...

Ashley: // Something popped up in their way [SL].

Oleg: The mechanical engineers are suggesting.

Will: 49. Yes, yes, but we have stopped this for them. We have actually…

Ashley: Wait, 49?

Oleg: 49-46.

Ashley: // I see 49 now. Ah, yes, yes, we have already suggested that.

Will: // That’s one of ours. So, which, which... which, which point did they say is the best?

Ashley: 30-45.

00:26:29:29

Will: 30-45.

Vika: It’s okay, these ones.

Salah: 40 // [UI]

Will: // 100% water loss. 100% water loss.

Vika: Boo.

Salah: // For 30-45.

Vika: // Yeah.

Ashley: // Okay.

Will: 30-45, 100% water loss.

Vika: Do you want to eat nuts?

Oleg: Yes.

Vika: There is “Babushkino Lukoshko.”

00:26:59:19

Oleg: Yes, I will probably take “Babushkino.”

Vika: There are prunes.

Oleg: Uh-huh. That’s it, thank you.

Will: Boo.

Vika: Boo.

Will: Is it hot here or...?

Vika: It became hotter.

Will: Hmm.

00:27:31:00 – 00:28:08:11

[no audio]

Ashley: I’m s... I swear, it’s the bottle, it’s not me.

Vika: Uh-huh.

Oleg: Why are you batting your eyelashes? Here, take it, man.

Vika: Do you want more? There is more.

Oleg: Yes, please. Thank you!

Vika: The fifth or [UI].

Oleg: No, no, this one is fine. She won’t take this one away.

00:28:30:00

Vika: But it’s not for sure.

Ashley: I eat all, all of them.

Oleg: Do you like all of them?

00:28:29:00 – 00:30:33:27

[no audio]

Ashley: My guys say 30-35 and 30-21 are pretty sub-optimal for our team.

Vika: What?

Ashley: Uh, 30-35 and 30-21 are not great for them, they said.

Vika: Yeah? Okay.

Salah: Yeah, they told me the same but I’m asking them the reason. They are just saying it’s not good.

Vika: Tell them that it’s easy.

00:31:03:03

Ashley: Well, we don’t give them reasons always for all our, uh, points either.

Will: They might, they might come back around to some of them later.

Ashley: And 49-46, must be aborted [SL] as well. Okay.

00:31:31:22

Oleg: How about this one: 20-35?

Ashley: I’ll be like, “Is there a leeway on the sub-optimal ones or is there a hard no?”

Vika: For me, it’s okay. 20-35. 20-35, guys.

00:32:00:19

Oleg: Will, is there anything?

Will: Huh?

Oleg: Is there anything in 20-35?

Will: 20-35, just a moment.

Salah: 20-35. [UI] it’s not good for you.

Will: 20-35, right?

Ashley: It’s not bad.

Will: 100% water loss.

Vika: Boo.

Ashley: Boo. Ha-ha.

00:32:39:25

Oleg: Even when monitoring, if you put the points next to each other, it doesn’t mean that they coincide. 

00:32:45:00 – 00:33:37:21

[no audio]

Vika: Guys, could you check please 41-46? 41-46.

Ashley: Let me see. 

Vika: // [sigh] What to do? [whispering] [UI]

Ashley: // Where?

Will: 96% water loss.

00:34:01:18

Vika: Instantly boo.

Ashley: Okay then.

00:34:27:00

Oleg: So, and how about 7-21?

Ashley: 7-21. [whispering]

Vika: Hmm. It’s not very good for me.

Will: Boo.

Ashley: Ho! It’s really not bad for me. Ha-ha.

Oleg: Do you really like this one?

Vika: 7-21. 7-21.

Oleg: 7-21.

Vika: 7-21.

Will: 7-21? 

00:35:00:03

Vika: Uh-huh.

Will: Uno momento.

Salah: 14-33 [whispering]	

Will: There is no water.

Salah: They told me, “We are looking at 14-33.”

Vika: Sorry?

Salah: They are looking, not... not me.

Will: Yeah, I got that... I got that, too.

Salah: Yeah. 14-33.

Will: Hmm.

00:36:00:02

Ashley: Thumbs up for me.

Will: That is...

Vika: 14.

Ashley: Uh-huh.

Will: 33. Yeah, that one is... it’s... I actually checked them already – it’s not a lot of water but it’s, I mean, I guess.

Vika: Ah!

Ashley: I like it, it’s pretty decent.

Vika: Oleg, please check 14-33 because the water is highly contaminated and... 

00:36:34:16

Oleg: 14-33 [whispering]. Oh, no! 

Will: No? Bad?

Oleg: No, but what are the reserves there? 

Vika: It’s everywhere there, uh, those that are muddy are over 50%. And small particles are over 50%.

Oleg: Right away, this won’t work. So, it’s a minimum 60% loss, or even more. It’s very dirty.

00:37:06:23

Vika: So, high level of contamination.

Ashley: Yes.

Oleg: Here is a good option, I think everyone will agree: 6-26. It’s just amazing.

Will: 6-26.

Oleg: Yes.

00:37:30:00

Will: Hmm. A small amount of water, but there is something.

Oleg: A 10% loss, so it’s practically clean.

Ashley: // Oh, I like it!

Will: // A 70... 75% loss. So, what should we do?

Oleg: Do you like that one?

Ashley: Yes! Ha-ha.

Oleg: But there is simply no water.

Will: Well, it is there, it just depends on the others.

00:37:59:17

Ashley: It’s great for me.

Vika: Sorry. Ha-ha.

Ashley: Ha-ha.

00:38:09:00 – 00:39:50:14

[no audio]

Ashley: So, maintenance says, “We are all right with falling back on 30-35 but scouting around would be sweet.” Ha-ha. 

Will: They say let’s keep...

Ashley: So, they like 30-35 but it’s not the best option. Yet, it could be. However, they would like us to verify other points. 

Salah: Yeah.

Oleg: // Here you go, 14-33...

Salah: // 30-35, they said they’re okay but not ready.

Vika: // [UI] 24-20.

Will: Uh.

Ashley: Crap! My feet are so swo... swollen. Ha-ha.

Will: 24.

Vika: 20.

Ashley: Damn it, I can’t even...

00:40:32:00

Oleg: Not bad. If not [SL], it’s very good.

Ashley: 20 what?

Vika: 24-20.

Ashley: 24-20.

Vika: 24-20.

Will: Uh-huh. // [UI].

Ashley: // It’s, it’s, it’s, it’s okay. Average. Ha-ha.

00:41:02:21

Oleg: It’s very tough, it’s rocky. There are rocks.

Will: From whom is this?

Vika: This is from [UI] Belg [SL].

Oleg: Hmm. Did you check 30-45?

00:42:02:18

Ashley: Yes.

Will: Yes. It’s a 100% water loss there.

Oleg: Uh-huh.

00:42:07:00 – 00:44:03:20

[no audio]

Will: Boo.

Vika: Do you think so?

Will: Yes, because my camera has switched off for some reason.

Ashley: Ah! Shit!

Will: It happens.

Vika: Boo.

00:44:17:00 – 00:44:42:10

[no audio]

Ashley: So, mechanical engineer is now saying that they tried a bunch of points. Basically that all weren’t working for many of them and said they all kind of circled back to 30-35. That they agreed that they could go for that one. 

Will: Nice. I’m about it.

00:44:57:18

Ashley: And we... And we all agree on 30-35, right? // But here, they said that they had checked numerous points and come back to 30-35, considering this option.

Oleg: // Yes.

Vika: // [UI]

Will: // Yes, it was actually really good.

Salah: // [UI] okay.

Oleg: But we said right away that it was fine.

Ashley: Yes, but they wanted to see other options.

Will: Maybe… maybe we found a better one. It’s just the most important is that they wanted to verify. 

Ashley: Well, if you want to check another one, // you can take a look at 16-27. Ha-ha.

Vika: // Yes but no.

00:45:33:11

Salah: You are saying 14-33?

Will: We’ve already checked that one.

Salah: We checked already this point, right?

Ashley: Mech... The mechanical engineer said that 14-33 is not a great option as a whole. 

Oleg: Ah! // The water it very clean, // with minimal losses.

Will: // Yeah.

Salah: // Who said?

Ashley: // The mechanical engineer. 

Oleg: Will, // please check 9-32.

Salah: // Here [SL] also was an okay point for us as well.

Will: Not really. // I mean, it’s not a lot of water there. 9-33, right?

Ashley: // Mechanical engineer on the engineering team, “We tried 14-33 and it was not a great option for us as a whole.”

Oleg: // 9-32, 9-32.

Will: // 9-32.

00:46:02:00

Salah: [UI] was an okay point for us, that’s good.

Vika: For me, it’s okay.

Ashley: Ha-ha. I don’t know where [UI].

Will: Not bad.

Oleg: Uh, a 10% loss for me, overall.

Will: For me, it’s a 69% loss, but there is a lot of water there, so…

Ashley: Which one?

Will: // 9-32. It’s not bad.

Vika: // 9-32. 9-32.

Oleg: This one // [UI], from the first one, 30-35, which we have suggested.

Salah: // [UI]. Ha-ha.

00:46:30:13

Ashley: 9-32 is not bad. Not the best option but not bad.

Oleg: But is it worse than 30-35?

Ashley: Just a second! // Ha-ha.

Vika: // Ha-ha.

Ashley: Ah, no, much better!

Oleg: Better?

Ashley: Yes. Seriously.

Oleg: But why are you saying it like this?

00:46:51:00

Ashley: Because there is less accessibility. But with regard to the number of people that we can have there, this location is great.

Oleg: Well, I like this one better, it is flatter.

Ashley: But this one will be more expensive.

Vika: Boo.

Oleg: Why are you counting money?

Ashley: But… ha-ha.

Vika: You are thinking only about money.

Ashley: Ha. Hey, space programs are not made of money. Ha-ha.

Vika: Ha-ha.

Oleg: Ash.

00:47:30:00

Ashley: Okay. So, // are we offer… offering them 9-32?

Vika: // All right [UI].

Oleg: // Yes. Will says that in principle it is there.

Will: Uh-huh, uh-huh, yes.

Vika: It’s fine for me too.

Oleg: And it’s not bad either. Uh, 5-32. It’s a good strand.

00:48:02:00

Will: No.

Vika: Hmm.

Oleg: So, this one won’t work then.

Ashley: Did you check 16-27?

Vika: No.

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Vika: Uh, 16, um, it’s Oleg’s point.

Ashley: Ha-ha. A! Okay.

Vika: I, um, just a sec.

00:48:20:00 – 00:49:18:26

[no audio]

Ashley: They also said that 28-21 was a very, uh… um, option for... for them.

00:49:32:00

Oleg: 28-21?

Ashley: Uh-huh. 

Oleg: Well, I think we’ve already suggested this one. It’s actually not, not that good.

Ashley: Will, how about you?

Oleg: [sigh] Muddy. 

Will: Ah, which one?

00:49:58:25

Ashley: // 28-21.

Salah: // 28-21. Right, they sent it.

Oleg: Ha-ha. [sigh]

Will: Wait, which one?

Ashley: They sent us 28-21. And...

Will: 100% water loss.

Ashley: And we wanted to suggest 9-32, right? That’s what we’ve agreed on before.

Will: What?

Ashley: Did we agree on suggesting 9-32 earlier?

00:50:31:07

Will: I don’t know. Yes. I think we did.

Ashley: Okay.

Oleg: [yawning]

Vika: Stop…

Oleg: Ha-ha.

Vika: … this contagion. Ha-ha!

00:50:59:00

Oleg: Stop spreading it, right?

Vika: Ha-ha.

Ashley: You can use the floor.

Oleg: That’s okay. I see that you woke up.

Ashley: If you want to sleep on the floor, you can.

Oleg: Would you like a half? Would you like me to share with you?

Ashley: I’m focus… I have to focus now. Ha-ha.

Vika: Have to control yourself? 

Oleg: Yes.

Vika: // Boo.

00:51:30:13

Ashley: // [UI] water loss according to our sedimentologist. 

Will: // Boo.

Vika: // Boo. Check. [SL]

00:52:00:00 – 00:52:13:21

[no audio]

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Oleg: 24-27.

Ashley: Why did you write me a message? Ha-ha.

Salah: Which one?

Ashley: // You said, “20-21: 100% water loss.”

Oleg: // Little loss with the presence of water.

Salah: Ah, [UI] okay.

Ashley: Ha-ha. What?

00:52:30:12

Oleg: 24-27.

Ashley: 24...

Vika: If you can purify it, then it’s okay.

Oleg: Yes. At… at the first stage.

Ashley: 27.

Will: Hmm. Not the best option.

Ashley: [sigh].

Salah: Which one? The Martian terrain specialist.

Ashley: Meteorology.

Salah: What was it?

00:53:00:17

Oleg, Ashley: [chewing]

Ashley: At the bottom somewhere. 

Salah: Another space factor this is...

Ashley: Let me. Ha-ha.

Salah: That is... No. Martian? Ah, okay, okay, okay understood.

Ashley: No, no worries. // I don’t, I don’t mind. Ha-ha.

Vika: // Haven’t they reply yet?

00:53:29:00

Salah: I was going to send it and that...

Ashley: Ah!

Salah: ... uh, other chart. [UI]

Ashley: What about 24-27? Yes?

Oleg: Huh?

Vika: Huh? Ha-ha.

Will: Yes.

Vika: Oua? [a mocking version of the sound “Huh?”] Ha-ha.

Oleg: Yes?

Ashley: Uh-huh. Not bad.

Vika: Hmm.

00:54:00:00

Salah: 28-21. They said, “We are locking 28-21.”

Ashley: I think Will said there was a 100% water loss there.

Will: 28-21? Yeah.

Salah: Yeah.

Will: Yeah, 100% water loss.

00:54:37:00

Will: Mmm.

Vika: Ha-ha. What’s going on?

Ashley: Mmm, mmm.

Vika: Mmm.

Will: Mmm.

00:54:50:00 – 00:55:16:20

[no audio]

Oleg: How about this one: 15-25?

Vika: Not the best option, but it’s okay.

Oleg: We already have two.

Will: Which one?

Vika: 15-25.

Will: Not the best one, but there is some water.

Vika: Here. [whispering]

00:56:01:00

Vika: 15-14?

Ashley: 14 what?

Vika: 15-14.

Ashley: Okay.

Will: Hmm.

Ashley: It’s okay.

Vika: Oleg, what do you think?

00:56:31:00

Oleg: I will say in a moment.

Ashley: MechE says, “10 minutes left, at // 6... 7:16.” So, I guess 7 minutes left.

Will: // [sigh] 

Oleg: Again these parameters.

Will: Uh-huh. 

Oleg: Again, these are large expenses... losses. If it were at least below 60, then it would be possible... to purify. But in this case. This 5... 5... 5-88 that they have, uh, um, is not good.

00:57:01:17 – 00:57:09:00

Ashley: Parts source. I see we have a more competent team this week actually, asking good questions. Hmm, hmm, hmm.

00:57:45:00

Salah: I think they chose 28-21 because they are asking me about the, uh, equipment material, drill head, these things.

00:57:56:23

Will: Hmm.

00:58:15:00

Will: Hmm! 

Oleg: This one is very clean. 14-16. 

00:58:43:12

Ashley: Martian terrain says, “Let’s rock and roll with 30-40... 30-... 30-35.” // I understand that they decided to go with 30-35.

Vika: // It is better than 14-16.

Will: // Yes, right.

Vika: // Perfect.
 
Oleg: // Perfect.

Will: 30-35?

Ashley: Yeah.

Will: Okay.

00:59:00:21

Salah: Yeah.

Oleg: Are we filling out “Signot”?

00:59:16:00 – 00:59:46:16

Ashley: Oh! Forgot. Okay. Costs are [SL] low. This is great, guys.

Salah: 9-33.

Ashley: Seriously. Visibility and [UI].

00:59:58:24 – 01:01:04:27

[no audio]

Ashley: He said, “9-32 was a great option, but 30-35 was a better option overall.”

Will: Okay. Cool [SL]


01:01:13:00 – 01:01:25:24

[no audio]

Oleg: Uh, he is filling out little by little.


01:01:29:00 – 01:02:04:19

[no audio]

Ashley: Come on, why can’t I pick?


01:02:10:00 – 01:03:08:19

[no audio]

Ashley: It keeps changing my fucking shit.

Will: I keep getting signals that they want 9-32.

Ashley: What? Ha-ha.

Will: I don’t know. Upper [UI] is like 9-32, but it would be like 4 minutes ago, so I am not sure.

Salah: They are asking the same [UI].

Ashley: Also, who... why I keep changing my things and something keeps changing back.

01:03:32:22

Vika: Ha-ha.

Will: I kind of want to just drop 9-32 in there. Ha-ha.

Vika: // Ha-ha.

Will: // Just change it now. Ha-ha.

Ashley: Yellow and red. It means yellow is [UI], it’s fundraising. Yeah. [UI] Okay.

01:04:01:00 – 01:04:23:19

[no audio]

Will: Is everybody good?

Oleg: So, already.

Salah: Yes.

Oleg: I’ve already put one.

Will: Yes.

Salah: I signed off?

Will: I guess so.

Ashley: Operation started, what do you think, so. Everybody gave their...

Oleg: Uh-uh. It’s not okay for me yet.

Ashley: Oh! Because…

Salah: Yes, we signed off.

Ashley: Okay.

01:04:57:14

Vika: Do you fill out your fields?

Will: Fields?

Vika: Well, here. Do you fill out your rows where…?

Will: // I don’t have to.

Salah: // Fields? [sigh]

Vika: Me either. Why?

Will: It fills out right away because we don’t have to do anything there...

Vika: You have such privileges! Ha. Everyone is waiting for you, Will. Well, it’s okay, me too, ha-ha.

Oleg: Crap!

Salah: Oleg, only you, huh?

Oleg: Yes, they don’t let me. Well, I just start, // and I'm thrown right out.

01:05:30:29

Ashley: // Wait.

Vika: Wait, wait.

Salah: Yeah, okay.

Ashley: Now, everyone...

Will: Has benefitted, yes.

Ashley: Wow!

Will: Downloaded and benefitted. Let’s do it quickly, like, quickly. // So, now.

Vika: // So, what are we doing? We immediately proceed to Project R... Ah! We…

Will: Now, we close it, turn it off. Ah no, we leave... We leave this on, right?

Ashley: Yeah. Uh-huh.

Will: Okay.

Ashley: We leave this on. // All right.

Will: // Okay.

Oleg: So, we don’t turn it off, do we?

Vika: The questionnaires there.

Will: Yes, we keep it now in [UI] 9, I think.

Ashley: [UI] 9, yeah.

01:06:00:26 – 01:12:26:16

Vika: Are we taking only one test for now?

Ashley: Uh-huh.

Vika: Thank you! [whispering]

Ashley: You are welcome! [whispering] [UI]

01:13:01:14

Vika: Boo!

Ashley: Do you want to say something?

Oleg: Ha-ha. There's still room to move around.

Ashley: Okay. Ha-ha. But did you want to do something else… I mean, to say something else?

Oleg: What do you mean?

Vika: Hmm, hmm.

Oleg: What did you imply?

Ashley: Ta-ta-ta. Okay. [reading, mumbling]

01:13:22:18 – 01:16:42:22

[no audio]

Ashley: Ha-ha. 

Vika: Uh, I think it’s time for me to go.

Oleg: There is nowhere to run.

Ashley: Oh, my hair, ah! // Crap! Ah!

01:16:59:20

Vika: // This is the spirit, it’s that spirit… the spirit that was in your shower…

Ashley: // Damn it, my hair!

Vika: Boo.

Ashley: Oh, ah!

Oleg: Ha-ha.

Vika: You know who is the best barber here?

Ashley: // Yes, I do, I do.

Vika: // Do you remember that? Okay.

Oleg: // You shouldn’t walk around with your long hair down.

Vika: // You know where I am leading.

Oleg: // Everyone is bald and only you are hairy.

Vika: Boo.

Ashley: Man. Okay.

Vika: Every family has a black sheep. Ha-ha. Sorry.

Oleg: Ha-ha.

Ashley: What? 

Oleg: Ha-ha.

01:17:30:29

Ashley: What?

Oleg: Ha-ha.

Vika: Ha-ha. It’s like, I don’t know. How do you explain this joke?

Will: What? [UI]

Vika: Well, when a family has a black sheep, // how to say? [UI]

Oleg: // Ha-ha.

Will: Uh, um, it’s like everyone has that uncle.

Ashley: // Oh! Ha-ha.

Will: // [UI].

01:17:58:18

Ashley: Are you trying to say it’s me? Ha-ha.

Vika: Sorry.

Ashley: Will’s face, ha-ha, I’m...

Will: We are [UI] always trusted.

Ashley: Ha-ha. I love it.

Will: That’s all I know.

Salah: [UI] over there. It’s so close here.

Vika: [sigh]

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Salah: It’s so close here.

Ashley: I can’t.

Oleg: What is going on with you? You can’t sit still.

Vika: What is happening here?

01:18:29:13

Ashley: Ha-ha. It’s two men with legs here, it’s okay. Ha-ha. Okay. I’m looking at everything [SL].

Oleg: What did we have next? Messages?

Vika: Yes.

Ashley: Hmm.

Salah: Yes, ha-ha.

Vika: // My favorite actually.

Oleg: // Oh, wow! The camera turned off.

Vika: Boo. // Mine is still working. Click!

Oleg: // Just like that.

Salah: What? We should switch the camera... camera off?

01:19:00:27

Ashley: No, no, no. // His turned off.

Vika: // No. 

Salah: Ah!

Vika: But if you want, it’s, you know. 

Salah: Okay.

Vika: Yeah.

Oleg: Ah! I got it! It reacts to... uh, on the left, when you minimize it.

Vika: Really?

Ashley: But you… Yes, we always // say that minimizing is not allowed.

Oleg: // No, no, well, no. I don’t minimize it on the top but on the right. Here, at the bottom in this one, here, in this one.

Salah: // It is too difficult, isn’t it?

Ashley: // Yes, but it is the same, right? No?

Oleg: // Yeah.

Will: // [UI] a mistake.

01:19:30:28

Salah: // Ah! A mistake, right?

Will: // Error. Yeah.

Salah: [UI]

Will: To you?

Salah: Yeah, I know, to me, I mean [UI].

Vika: // About what?

Ashley: // Okay.

Will: // Yeah, I got it too. Yeah I did it. I mean, I did it, I got it...

Salah: // You got it also? It didn’t work. They repeated it today twice with, with their program. 

Will: // Uh-huh.

Salah: It works in the file, if you open it in the file, it serves stress [SL] five, I think, there is a folder OS.

01:20:03:07

Will: I’ll take a look.

Salah: Yeah.

Oleg: Have you already launched Renet?

Ashley: Uh-uh.

Salah: But once I copy it to the desktop, it didn’t work.

Will: Yeah, same.

Ashley: Fuck!

Vika: What happened?

Ashley: I always forget there is a second part to this survey.

Vika: Still doing?

Ashley: Yes. Ha-ha.

01:20:30:20

Vika: Okay. No worry, we are waiting for you. Ha-ha.

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Salah: Yes?

Vika: Yes. The same. Ha-ha.

Salah: Ha-ha. 

Ashley: I hate you, guys all. Just kidding.

Oleg: Where is your anchor?

Ashley: What?

Oleg: Where is your anchor?

Ashley: I don’t know what an “anchor” means.

Oleg: Don’t you know the word “anchor”?

Vika: Well, it’s not an anchor, it’s breaks. Ha-ha.

01:21:01:09

Oleg: Well, I tried to express myself more politely.

Ashley: What is it? Come here.

Oleg: Do you know that boats... ships have a stopper?

Ashley: Yes.

Oleg: So, where is your anchor?

Vika: Something which can decrease your speed.

Ashley: I’m trying to concentrate.

Vika: Ha-ha. Sorry.

Ashley: I think // everybody... 

Will: // Give me, quickly.

Ashley: // ... Everybody here is...

Vika: // No.

Will: // This.

Vika: What? What do you want?

Will: “Babushkino Lukoshko.”

01:21:30:00

Salah: One for me also.

Will: [UI]

Salah: Okay. Thank you!

Vika: What do you want?

Will: Is there any other option?

Vika: No, there is not.

Will: Only this?

Vika: Ah, yes, there is.

Will: No. Boo.

Salah: [UI]

Will: All of them are flavored.

Salah: Ah!

Will: [UI].

Salah: Uh-huh.

01:21:57:29

Vika: Hmm.

Ashley: Okay.

Oleg: // Really?

Vika: // Ha-ha.

Ashley: Damn it, how can you think about all the questions so fast?

Oleg: You shouldn’t deliberate on them. You should reply what you think about it right away.

Vika: I think them over.

Oleg: Ha-ha.

01:22:30:00

Oleg: Well, no, obviously you think them over. But you don’t have to deliberate on them for several minutes.

Ashley: However, if you are constantly // talking.

Vika: // Or maybe… or maybe for several days. Ha-ha. What?

Will: // Ha-ha. Grandmother [SL]

Vika: // Ha-ha.

Oleg: Who else?

Ashley: I, I // already have.

Salah: // Who else?

Oleg: Who else?

Salah: [UI].

01:23:00:20

Ashley: Hmm. Ha-ha.

Salah: We are waiting for what? Ha-ha.

Ashley: Not me.

Vika: Are you also ready?

Will: No, no, I didn’t login.

Ashley: // Ha-ha.

Vika: // Really?

Oleg: // Ha-ha.

Vika: // Really? 

Salah: Ah, we are still waiting on, uh, um.

Will: Uh-huh.

Vika: Now, we know who is delaying the process.

Ashley: Ha-ha.

01:23:29:06

Will: [UI] is here doing her thing, uh.

Vika: // Ha-ha.

Ashley: // Ha-ha.

Oleg: Okay.

Will: Boo.

01:23:56:18

Vika: Very cool [SL].

Ashley: // Ha-ha.

Vika: // Ha-ha. Oh, my God!

01:24:36:23

Ashley: That’s weird.

Will: You are weird.

Ashley: // Ha-ha.

Vika: // Ha-ha.

Ashley: We already know that, Will.

Will: We are all a little bit weird, I think.

Ashley: I feel like I just got one that is supposed to come to me, but I guess it’s not.

Will: Yeah sometimes I get one that’s like, “Who is the person that checks the sediment?” And I am like, “Uh.”

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Will: Anyway, we are not talking.

01:25:00:03

Ashley: Right, right, right, right. No talking.

01:25:02:08 – 01:28:08:22

Salah: And I’m done. [SL]

Will: Boo.

Vika: Boo.

Will: Extra boo.

Oleg: Oh, my God!

Ashley: All right.

Vika: // Thank you, guys!

Will: Cool.

Ashley: Thanks for another session... // another great session!

Vika: // Can you please give me a table?

Will: // No.

Salah: Ha-ha.

Vika: Quickly. Bye-bye.
