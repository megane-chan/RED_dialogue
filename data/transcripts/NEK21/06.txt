Will: It’s popping. Okay. 

Oleg: Okay, and…

Ashley: Is the video on and recording? Does everyone have it? Okay.

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: So, today is December 28th, 2021. It’s mission day fifty-four. The time is 3:25PM. Three, two, one. //Mark.

All: //Mark. 

Oleg: Okay, and open.

Ashley: Just don’t minimize as always. 

Oleg: RED Project?

00:00:30:10

Ashley: Yeah…Project RED Design. 

Salah: [UI]

Ashley: What?

Salah: The book. 

00:00:38:18 – 00:01:46:24

[no audio]

Oleg: Start by writing that…

Ashley: Well, I will write that we are ready here. 

Oleg: Are you writing to your group only?

Ashley: Yes. Do you think that I should be writing to everyone?

Will: No, I mean, I’ve written to the person specialist and our geology team. 

Ashley: Yeah. Okay.

00:02:10:19 – 00:03:23:29

[no audio]

Oleg: Ash, how did we add a window here? Where we were looking – there was a window here. 

Ashley: Yes. Hmm…

Oleg: Maybe…I don’t have it for some reason. 

Ashley: Yeah. Because I have it in decisions. 

Oleg: Yes. You have it.

Ashley: And if you click…select


00:04:00:00

Ashley: item, will it appear? 

Oleg: Well, here. If here I…, it allows me. Then I have it …it’s on for me. Here I have it…

Ashley: So, for example…

Vika: Guys, can you check please seven point eleven. 

Ashley: Seven eleven?

Vika: Yep. 

00:04:41:17

Oleg: It seems mine was not loaded properly. 

Ashley: Did you close it again?

Oleg: Well, I thought about that, too. 

Ashley: Yes. It happened this way last time for us. 

Oleg: Yes. So what? Then I will re-load it. 

00:05:12:24

Will: I like it.

Vika: Oh, yeah! The thing that I like, Will likes it too. 

Will: Okay. 

Salah: What’s the level of water?

Will: There are two hundred and twenty-one thousand…Was it liters available? And then after loss there is a hundred fifteen thousand which is really good. So, that’s elite. 

00:05:44:01

Salah: For me it’s okay. 

Vika: Okay. For you, Ash?

Ashley: I think it’s okay, too, for me. 

Vika: What?!

Ashley: No, it seems fine. I’m just double checking here. 

Vika: Oleg, are you in?

Oleg: No. My server says, it doesn’t let me in. 

Vika: It doesn’t want to play with you. 

Oleg: “Please check your credit”. Error [UI]

Ashley: [UI]. Let’s…

00:06:15:08

Ashley: They said if there are problems, we can…Okay. Can we check to make sure the website is entered correctly?

Oleg: Sure. Yes. So…Delta Red…delta Red [UI]…Yes…[SL]nine, slash…

00:06:46:09

Oleg: [UI] production…Yes. Everything is correct. 

Ashley: Okay. [UI]…Everything is correct here, too?

Vika: I will be a bit slow. 

Ashley: [UI]…Huh. And it’s definitely your username, yes?

Oleg: Well, here. I…

Ashley: Yes. 

Oleg: I am writing from here. 

00:07:18:16

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: Maybe, I should enter the password one more time. But last time I also…

Will: Also – ten thirty. Ten thirty. It’s about half as good for me as the other one but it’s still very good. It’s a good option.

Salah: Ten?

Will: Ten thirty.

Vika: Alright. 

00:07:46:13

Ashley: Ooh. That’s good…I like. I like. 

Will: Okay. Okay. 

Oleg: Okay. 

Salah: //What’s wrong with seven eleven?

Ashley: //Do you…Will…

Will: Nothing. It’s good. 

Oleg: Will…

Vika: //Just searching the options. 

Ashley: //[UI]. He can’t get into the server. 

Salah: Huh?

Will: There is another link, I think. 

Ashley: Yeah. I just checked it with him. 

00:08:15:05

Ashley: From the radiogram. It’s not working. 

Salah: Ten thirty.

Ashley: Okay. [SL] What are you going to do?

Will: You closed out chrome and everything completely?

Ashley: Yeah. Yeah. 

Vika: It’s okay. 

Oleg: Here – same thing.

Vika: //Ten thirty. 

Ashley: //Same thing. Yeah. 

Oleg: NG…NG one//delta org 

Salah: //[SL] Three thirty-six.

00:08:52:10

Oleg: There. It’s loaded now. Can you see?

Ashley: Magic touch. How do I say it?

Oleg: Yes. 

Ashley: I don’t know in…

Oleg: [UI]

Vika: It is working always here. 

Oleg: Next time you will be getting my computer ready. 

Salah: For me it’s okay also. 

Ashley: Ten thirty is good. 

Salah: Both. 

Ashley: Check //ten thirty. Oh, seven…

Vika: //Seven eleven and ten thirty. 

Ashley: Did somebody from Chicago…Did somebody from Chicago respond to you or not?

Oleg: No…Seven eleven, yes?

Ashley: Mhm. Seven eleven and ten thirty. 

00:09:35:16

Oleg: Ash, you set it up, but not completely. …It doesn’t want to open. I opened it, and it’s not working. 

Ashley: //And if you simply click here, what will happen?

Vika: //[SL] How many messages did you write?

Oleg: [UI]

Will: What?

Vika: How many messages did you write to them?

Will: Enough.

Vika: I can see. 

Oleg: [UI]

Ashley: Just click something there. Anything happening?

00:10:05:18

Ashley: Man! He is still having issues. Like now he can’t get the points to come out. 

Oleg: And now even…I can do it here. 

Will: Just re-load the website.

Ashley: Everything, all…

Will: No, no, no. Just the site. Sometimes it just takes a minute. 

Ashley: Well, we’ve been closing it and opening it, like, entirely a couple times now. So, now we are actually on Project RED, thank God!   

Oleg: Are you saying that I should reboot the computer?

Will: No, no, no. //Just refresh the page.

Ashley: //But now none of the points are coming. 

Will: Just…

00:10:30:16

Will: This. This…//It looks right, just a bit slow. Then it will take some time. 

Ashley: //Or here.

Ashley: [UI].

Oleg: Is there any caffeine there? 

Ashley: I don’t think so. I think there will be no caffeine for 6+ months. 

Oleg: //I don’t know.

Vika: //Who knows?

Oleg: What if?

00:11:01:02

Oleg: Who is that now?

Ashley: Katya. 

Oleg: Can you imagine, she will be delivered with the cargo?

Ashley: I like ten thirty very much.

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: And seven eleven, too. Both. 

Vika: Mhm.

Oleg: So, well…

00:11:32:19

Ashley: Come on, Chicago! …Where you at? 

Vika: Do you remember that last time we had the same situation?

Ashley: Whereas, like, they were delayed?

Vika: Yeah. 

Will: I mean, I think they log on and then it’s a…

Oleg: Ash…at least now the points are here, but still nothing is working. 

Will: Sometimes, it’s just…

Ashley: Maybe, simply…//If we have the time, you can fully reboot the computer.

Will: //It takes a long time to load.

00:12:02:00

Will: No. It’s just…

Oleg: Server?

Will: It’ll take the same amount of time. 

Oleg: Well, I will wait for now //five minutes.

Ashley: //Or turn off HRP and turn it on again?

Will: That’s not the point. 

Oleg: Well, then we’ll wait. 

Vika: Chicago. 

Ashley: Because they are not even in the same place. It’s not the same, they are in different places. 



00:12:35:26

Oleg: They are still sleeping. 

Ashley: Six hours. [SL] I also think [UI]

Oleg: On the twenty-eighth, when it’s before…it’s already past Christmas, the New Year’s.

Vika: Hm.

Ashley: That’s right. Yeah, that’s right! They //are all on a holiday break now.

Salah: //Will, check twenty-two…twenty-two nine. 

Will: Twenty-two nine?

Salah: Twenty-two nine.

Ashley: Twenty-two nine?

00:13:09:03

Will: No water. 

Ashley: You know, I should really wait to put the mark down before I hear…until I hear Will say something. 

Vika: Right. 

Ashley: Darn it!

Oleg: I’ll try again. 

00:13:36:12

Vika: [UI]

Will: Cool. 

Ashley: There. 

Vika: Thank you so very much. You don’t have to send it off today. 

Ashley: I wish you could delete the red dots from your map.

Salah: Mhm. 

00:14:00:00

-

00:14:23:06

Oleg: Oh.

Vika: What’s the matter?

Oleg: It’s working…Eureka! It’s an amazing spot!

Vika: Which one?

Oleg: Seven eleven. 

Vika: And what about ten thirty?

Oleg: Ten thirty? Hold on. 

00:14:54:07

Oleg: Okay, ten thirty. No. Well…

Vika: Why?

Oleg: Well, in principle, it might do. I don’t object. 

Will: Seven eleven looks like our best one, yes?

Oleg: Yes. Seven eleven is just great. 

Ashley: Nice job, Vika!

Vika: Hm?

Ashley: Nice job finding it. 

Oleg: Does seven eleven work for you too?

Will: Yes. 

Oleg: Well, then we accept it and that’s it. Everything is done. 

Vika: And we will go ahead and do our own things. We’ll just inform Chicago of the fact. 

Salah: Which point now we agreed?

Vika: Seven eleven. 

Salah: What about ten thirty? 

00:15:30:12

Ashley: We also think that’s fine, but //seven eleven is better. 

Will: It’s about half as good in terms of water. 

Vika: Oh…It’s you again. 

Will: You again. 

Vika: You are living a verified life…Darn…

Oleg: If we think about and consider it //there’s little sense in this there? 

Ashley: //What if there is some?

Oleg: It’s better…well, in your opinion, where is a better place for it? On a slope or on a plain?

00:17:00:07

Oleg: I think it’s the plain. 

Ashley: On the plain. 

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: Definitely. 

Oleg: If it’s on the plain, then this can lead to the deposits being too deep. That’s where the crater is, there’s bare ground. Will, do you have a preference if there’s a plain somewhere... There’s right here... in the upper right corner.

Will: It’s random for me for some reason. First it works for me, then it doesn’t work. 

00:17:30:16

Will: It doesn’t affect the…

Oleg: So, we need to do some research here. We need to look…

Will: This…This…I didn’t notice any…this…

Oleg: What is your parameter? Maybe, I have it shown too. 

Will: For me, it’s the average water loss и amount of water available, but I think it’s only for me. 

Oleg: Mhm.

Ashley: And what do you think about twenty-eight four?

Will: Let me check it.

00:18:00:14

Will: Which one? Twenty-eight…

Ashley: Mhm. Four. 

Will: Twenty-eight four. 

Oleg: Oh, wow. Who is walking around there?

Ashley: Seriously? Very often.

Vika: Very dirty water.

Oleg: Oh, yes. Very dirty.

Ashley: No? Okay. 

Oleg: So, it’s not the best option, not even by a long shot. 

Ashley: And what about water?

Will: Too little. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Will: But now…

Ashley: No problem.

Will: Twenty twenty-four. 

00:18:29:07

Salah: Depth is okay for me. 

Ashley: Thanks…One. One person likes…the spot. 

Salah: //Actually, this point – seven eleven…See the depth?

Will: //Fifty-four forty-six. 

Ashley: Is that quite deep or compared to…

Salah: Yeah, it’s deep. 

Ashley: What’s the other one?

Salah: This is seven eleven. 

Ashley: Uh-uh. What’s…

Salah: The other one – thirty. 

Ashley: What about down here?

Salah: So, you see the one you choose. 

00:19:01:23

Ashley: Hm. Oh! 

Salah: That’s what’s my concern. I’m actually looking at the depth. 

Oleg: Oh, here’s an option that’s not bad - //forty fifty. 

Salah: //Usually I’m checking if it’s about a thousand.

Oleg: Look at forty fifty.

Ashley: Forty fifty. 

Will: Which one did you say? Forty…

Vika: Fifty.

Oleg: Forty fifty. 

Ashley: Oh-oh-oh. There, like…

Vika: High water loss. 

00:19:30:02

Vika: Almost 100%.

Will: There’s no water there in the end. 

Oleg: And the fact that it’s deep doesn’t matter, does it?

Will: Deep for what, if there’s no water there?

00:20:00:26

Ashley: Where?

Oleg: I think we should start with where there is water. Otherwise, what is the point of us evaluating?

Will: Yes. It is, just…I am looking so if…

Oleg: Here’s forty forty. It’s these spots. Here, if we look specifically for a plain that would work for everyone…

Will: Let’s look at fourteen six. Fourteen six. 

00:20:30:28

Salah: Fourteen?

Will: Six.

Ashley: I mean, it’s less desirable for me but…

Vika: //What do you say in terms of contamination?

Salah: //Impossible for me. 

Ashley: Impossible?

Vika: It’s very high.

Ashley: Wow! That’s really deep. 

Oleg: Well, thirty. You can put filters, but much better than we received last time. Not great, but the issue can be resolved.

00:21:06:14

Oleg: So, it’s thirty by thirty. Simply, [UI].

Ashley: Oh, I see. Fluid engineer says…Okay, they are starting now. 

Oleg: Oh.

Ashley: I mean…

Vika: Yeah, it’s okay. 

Salah: Which one?

00:21:31:00

Vika: Fourteen six. 

Oleg: Okay, we are all…

Vika: What?

Will: Fourteen six? It’s okay for you?

Vika: Yeah. 

Ashley: It’s not good, it’s not…

Vika: For me, contamination is //high.

Salah: //For me it’s not okay. 

Vika: No?
Salah: It’s too deep. Two thousand!

Vika: Fourteen six?

Ashley: Yeah. //It’s not great for me either, honestly.

Salah: //Two thousand two hundred fifty. 

Vika: Oh, okay. 

Oleg: They are waiting…

Ashley: Sorry.

Oleg: They just responded to me. They are saying the geologists are looking where

00:22:00:09

Oleg: there are deposits of water. After that, they will make a decision... so right now, I think Will’s most important mission is to find where there is water at all. After that, evaluate how much we will lose ... during the development.

Salah: They are so slow, you know?

00:22:31:12

Will: I mean, there is like four-minute…

Ashley: Three.

Will: Is it three?

Ashley: Three-minute each way, yeah. 

Will: Three-minute there and three-minute back. 

Salah: //So, it’s six minutes. Not sixty. 

Ashley: //Six minutes total. 

Will: Yeah, but they didn’t log on until just now. 

Ashley: Yeah. Apparently they were waiting for their structural geologist. 

Vika: [UI]

Ashley: Alright. 

00:23:06:08

Salah: [UI]

Oleg: [UI]… Okay, the meteorologist is making some noise here…Is that you?

Ashley: I am a meteorologist, yes. 

00:23:31:11

Oleg: Yes, me. Hello to Moscow. And why did you write to me?

Ashley: I wrote to all the teams. 

Oleg: I see.

Ashley: I want to be connected to everyone. 

Oleg: I see, I see. 

00:24:02:06

Oleg: Well, they responded with the same thing to you…I think they respond to everyone with the same thing. 

Ashley: I am also copy-pasting this. Pasting?

Oleg: Such a disgrace. 

00:24:23:19 – 00:24:42:20

[no audio]

Oleg: In short, there’s no water. There is no water on Mars. 

Will: Hm…mm…

Vika: [SL] Now what, we are not going?

Oleg: Turn around. …In this crater under the name…or under the title…

00:25:31:06

Vika: Only you are interested in that. 

Oleg: [UI]

Vika: Has someone else found something? Or is nobody looking and just waiting? …Yes.

Oleg: You know, how was it in TTB? “There’s no goal” – all rise. 

00:26:05:04

Oleg: When the geologist was upset, like…

Vika: Oh, really? Are we all feeling like sleeping already?

Oleg: Yes. 

00:26:31:22

Vika: Sorry. 

Ashley: Hm.

Will: Bla-la-la-la. 

Salah: So, we all agreed on points seven eleven and ten thirty?

Will: We are still looking. 

00:27:00:07

Salah: Check thirty-five twenty-two. 

Ashley: Thirty-five thirty-two?

Salah: Twenty-two.

Ashley: Twenty-two.

Will: 100% water loss. 

Oleg: Forty-five twenty-two?

Vika: You don’t need to look. 

Oleg: What, not at all?

Ashley: Weather is not so great there. Could reach a high population, but //a lot of safety zones. 

Vika: Can you repeat place? Which point?

00:27:31:05

Ashley: He said, thirty-five twenty-two. 

Vika: Thirty-five twenty-two. 

Ashley: Yes. Our meteorology costs are going to be quite high there due to all the yellow, orange and red zones we have. 

Salah: It’s [UI], you think?

Oleg: It’s not even shown for me. 

Vika: There’s very little water there. 

Ashley: Okay. We are scrapping. It won’t work.

Oleg: Who came up with it? For me, it’s outside the boundaries of the territory. 

00:28:01:16

Ashley: //Salik. 

Vika: //Outside the boundaries?

Oleg: Well, forty-five I can’t even see.

Will: Mhm-hm.

Ashley: No. It should be thirty-five. 

Will: Let’s try nineteen twenty-nine. 

Ashley: Nineteen…

Will: Nineteen twenty-nine. 

Ashley: Twenty-nine. 

00:28:30:28

Ashley: Well, it’s not too bad.

Oleg: We’ve already been there. Oh, everything is murky again…

Vika: High contamination. 

Oleg: Murky particles.

Salah: Very good for me. 

Ashley: Yeah. It’s not bad, really. 

Salah: Go ahead. 

Oleg: I can’t even filter it. 

Will: //What do you mean, you can’t?

Ashley: //Too much water there?

Will: There’s a lot of water there. But it’s less than seven eleven. 

00:29:01:26

Will: But it’s, like, just a bit. …what do you mean, you can’t even filter this water?

Oleg: Because it is very muddy and polluted water with small particles ... mineral.

Will: Mhm.

Oleg: That is, if you filter it, it will take me more than 60%.

Will: Mhm.

Ashley: What about right under it – at nineteen twenty-eight?

00:29:30:26

Will: Nineteen twenty-eight? Let’s take a look. 

Oleg: That is, if there are some large inclusions, then there is a loss of 10-30%. And when they are like this there, then it’s 60% loss.

Will: Mhm. 

Ashley: That has a //higher accessibility rate. 

Oleg: //[UI]

Vika: No. 

Will: No.

Ashley: Really?

Will: No.

Vika: Yes.

Will: There is no water. 

Vika: //A lot of contamination.

Ashley: //[UI] it’s so interesting. 

Vika: Hm?

Ashley: It’s so interesting. It’s only one…one number off, and it makes such a difference.

Will: I don’t think that’s how it works. 

Ashley: It’s not real, I know. But I’m just saying, like…

00:30:00:08

Ashley: Oh, my goodness! 

Oleg: O!

Vika: Hmm…

Oleg: I was thinking where is that meteorologist. Here he is. There, take that!  [UI] too, right?

Vika: Damn! …Mechanical engineer. 

00:30:30:12

Will: Materials specialist. 

Vika: Materials specialist. 

Salah: And you? Hydrologist, right?

Vika: Hm?

Ashley: Yep. Hydrogeologist.

Salah: Hydrogeologist.

00:30:50:29 – 00:31:48:16

[no audio]

Ashley: They’re really not responsive today, huh?

Salah: Yeah.

Will: Okay. They are logging in from different locations. Interesting. 

Ashley: Yeah. Last time they mentioned that. 

Salah: Did they mention this?

Ashley: To him they mentioned it. Who is actually responding to you?

Will: Structural geologist. 

Salah: They respond only [UI]

Vika: I don’t know why I can’t create a new point. 

00:32:42:13

Salah: So, nineteen twenty-nine was okay?

Ashley: It’s not bad. Yeah. 

Salah: For me it’s okay.

Ashley: So, we have three options.

Salah: This is the best one. 

Will: Yeah. Nineteen twenty-nine. Well, this ... this means that we are losing 60%. This means that we will have at the end ... This is not clear. If we lose it from the very beginning... I don’t know. It seems... it seems to work fine. Forty thousand or something...

00:33:12:02

Salah: What’s the loss of water?

Will: 66%. But there is like three hundred thousand there.

Salah: Yeah, but the depth for me is okay. So, it’s 1.20. 

Will: Okay. 

Salah: [SL] seven twenty. 

Will: Well, I mean... Simply put, I want to know if it’s completely... not at all?

Oleg: No. The losses will be at the maximum.

Will: Maximum.

Oleg: 60%.

Will: Yes, yes, yes.

Oleg: So, that means 

Will: Okay.

Oleg: the filtering system allows for filtering, but in this case it is too contaminated with small ones.

00:33:43:02

Will: Well, because there’s a lot of water there. So if it was another point where there is less water, I would say, like…

Vika: Less water. 

Will: Hm?

Vika: You’d say: “Less water”

Oleg: No.

Will: No. //Then I would say that there is no reason to waste time on this. And if there is so much water...

Vika: //Or you would say that there is no water. 

Oleg: Well, okay. 

Will: But it’s in the third place already. This is already far from the other ones that we have.

Oleg: But if you look at the remaining forty percent, will that allow you to provide the population with water? 

00:34:13:13

Will: Well, yes. It looks like it will work with some water. There are so many... there are three thousand... There we lose... two-thirds. So there is a hundred thousand left. And 60%... forty thousand is somehow, somewhere in a normal place. I mean, it’s not much, but it’s... It’s the same if we have another one, where we have a different level of loss or something. 

00:34:42:26

Will: [SL] Okay. …Operations is still [UI]. Okay, cool. They are currently saying…I said…They said that both…

Oleg: So then? Shall we pick this one?

Will: They said seven eleven and ten thirty weren’t the best places to build anything, but I told them that, like, “I understand, but seven eleven and ten thirty are our

00:35:15:06

Will: first ones. So if we can’t find anything better, then we have to choose one of them.” 

Ashley: Is it from those that we suggested?

Will: Yes. Yeah. 

Salah: Operations specialist said, “Seven eleven is pretty bad for me and some people on my side.”

Vika: Seven eleven?

Salah: Yeah. It’s bad for them.

Ashley: Well, fine. 

Vika: And ten thirty?

Salah: Still waiting for their reply. 

Vika: Hm.

00:36:04:04

Salah: [UI]

Oleg: They are now considering ten thirty. 

Will: Hold on.

Oleg: Seven eleven – no water.

Vika: What do they mean no water?

Oleg: Huh?

Vika: Why no water?

Oleg: Well, the mechanical says that for some reason.

Salah: So, the scenario of the [UI] everything is just to look for a point? There is no scenario for constructing the well? 

00:36:32:04

Ashley: Seems like it. I don’t know. We can ask Reynold. 

Salah: [UI] for every task.

Ashley: Yes. I don’t know. Maybe it would be useful to ask them to give us some feedback.

Vika: There’s a lot of water there. 

Will: Where?

Vika: Seven eleven.

Will: Seven eleven?

Vika: Yes.

Will: Oh, yes, yes. 

00:37:00:14

Will: And which one did Oleg say just now?

Oleg: They are looking at ten thirty now. 

Will: Oh, okay. It’s not like you found a new one.

Salah: Ten?

Oleg: Ten thirty.

Ashley: Yeah, the one that we…

Salah: Ah, okay. Ten thirty. 

Ashley: Mhm. Is there any water at thirteen thirty-eight?

Will: Two seconds. 

Ashley: Good accessibility and high population count.

Vika: Oleg, please look at thirty-three eighteen. 

00:38:00:24

Vika: Will you be able to filter it?

Will: Alright. What was that one, Ash?

Ashley: Thirteen thirty-eight. 

Oleg: Yes, it’s great. 

Vika: Guys. 

Will: There is a little bit of water there. Not a lot. Let me take a look. 

Vika: Thirteen thirty-eight. Can you take a look at thirty-three eighteen?

00:38:32:00

Ashley: Yes. Once I get these off. 

Vika: Mhm. 

Will: It’s not too bad. It’s not a lot but.

Vika: Which one?

Ashley: The one that I said? //Thirteen thirty-eight?

Will: //Thirteen thirty-eight. But it’s not going to be for the…And our structural geologist will want more water than that. 

Ashley: Mhm.

00:39:02:27 – 00:39:37:20

Ashley: Vika, what did you say? Oh, fuck! [UI]. Hang on. …Okay. Which one did you say? Sorry. 

Vika: Thirty-three eighteen. 

00:40:04:04

Ashley: No! 

Oleg: What does it mean “No!”?

Ashley: Very…

Will: Forty-seven.

Ashley: A lot…

Salah: Forty-five forty-seven, they are saying. 

Will: Okay. Let me take a look.

Ashley: Forty-five forty-seven.

Salah: Yeah. But I didn’t find it. Where is it?

Ashley: Forty-five forty-seven…

Salah: Is there forty-five?

Ashley: Yeah, where the heck is it?

Salah: Where is it?

00:40:30:00

Salah: I don’t have.

Will: You can. Just hit the “plus” button. 

Ashley: Yeah. There is no forty-five on the grid. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Will: What? //I was able to pull it up.

Oleg: //[UI]

Ashley: Where is it on your map?

Will: //I think it’s on the very top. 

Salah: //they said to look at forty-five…

Ashley: Forty-five forty-seven? My grid only goes up to forty.

Salah: //Me too. Same thing. 

Oleg: //Where is it?

Will: I know what’s happening. They have…You’d have to close //the grid cells thing. 

Oleg: //Do you see this?

Ashley: //Oh. The chat…Oh, I see. You should close…

Will: But you can also just type in 

00:40:59:29

Will: where is says “Grid Cells” you can just hit “plus”

Salah: Yeah. Yeah. 

Ashley: Yeah, but then I can’t see the information without the map open. 

Will: On the right-hand side you don’t see it?

Ashley: I mean, I don’t see…Oh, okay. I see what you’re saying. Yeah. Oh…

Salah: It’s okay. 

Ashley: You know, this whole time we didn’t actually see this part of the map. 

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: Literarily, all of the sessions that we’ve done we have not seen that part of the map.

Salah: Mhm.

Ashley: But I’m going to ex-nay that because there are literarily ten yellow zones, seven orange zones, six red zones.

00:41:29:23

Ashley: That means that the weather there is absolutely horrible. So, our meteorology cost would be extremely high. 

Will: What was it? Forty-five forty-seven?

Salah: Forty-five forty-seven.

Ashley: So, you can relay that to them. 

Salah: Forty-five forty-seven.

Ashley: Can’t do. 

Vika: No!

Ashley: Yeah, really. 

Vika: No!

Ashley: Like, it’s absolutely…it has…

Salah: It’s not good?

Ashley: That’s what I’m saying. There is like ten yellow, seven orange, six red zones. Meteorology cost would be //extremely extremely high. 

Oleg: //Very dirty.

Vika: Forty-five forty-seven?

00:42:00:02

Oleg: Yes, forty-five forty-seven. //There are too many rocks there.

Ashley: //I…I don’t like it there either. Why are they all responding to you and no one to me?

Oleg: Because you send spam to everyone, and they are thinking: “We don’t want to deal with her!”

Ashley: Even my own team is not responding. 

Vika: Nobody wants to talk to you. 

00:42:29:08

Oleg: They say: “Ash is so boring”. A pain in the neck. 

Ashley: As always, I will say to you – you’ll be missing me after eight months.

Oleg: So then, to Los Angeles [UI]?

Vika: No!

Ashley: “Why is it so quiet here? Oh, Ashley isn’t here…”

Oleg: Yes. “Why am I calmly making videos?”

Ashley: Because…

Oleg: And nobody is trying to get into the frame… 

00:43:01:22 – 00:43:37:03

[no audio]

Oleg: Are you trying to get on everyone’s nerves?

Ashley: What?

Oleg: Writing to everyone…

Salah: Forty-two seventeen. 

Ashley: Only my team.

Oleg: Hm.

Will: Forty-two seventeen?

Salah: Yes. 

Will: Forty-two seventeen. Great. And there is some water there but it’s so low that…

00:44:00:00

Will: Forty-two seventeen.

Oleg: Our meteorologists are writing. The meteo specialist is writing. [SL] She is getting on my nerves. 

Ashley: He is a materials specialist.

Oleg: No. Meteorologist. 

Ashley: Oh, meteorologist. 

Oleg: Martian. Martian Meteorology specialist. 

Ashley: Oh, yeah. 

Vika: [UI] Forty-two seventeen. 

Salah: Hm.

00:44:29:19

Oleg: Forty-two seven…Forty-two what?

Vika: Seventeen. Why can’t I see it?

Oleg: Because it’s to the right. Close the chat and you will see it. 

Vika: Okay, got it.

Salah: We found a new location…to explore. 

Ashley: It would also be expensive there, because the weather there is bad.

00:45:01:01

Oleg: Oh, no. Well, it’s just there…

Vika: Very dirty water. 

Oleg: Very.

Ashley: Yes. Okay, no then. 

Oleg: [SL] Breathe evenly. 

Ashley: Ah, okay. Oh, fuck! Damn it! //Oh, Shit! Damn it!

Salah: //[UI]

00:45:31:03

Ashley: Ah!

Vika: What happened?

Salah: She closed. 

Vika: Oh, my goodness! Again?

Ashley: Oh!

Oleg: You will break your eye now. 

Ashley: Sorry, Project RED. You get two parts to the thing now. 

Salah: Pretty bad for me [UI]

00:46:10:12

Oleg: If we had Google now. We’d say: “Where is there water on Mars?”

Vika: Yes, it’s very slow, so very slow. 

Oleg: Well? Any other points to look at?

00:46:33:25

Oleg: I have water that can be purified in every point. However, is it a puddle or the sea? A sea or an ocean? It’s not clear. …What’s the matter?

Ashley: I’ll keep it here. Okay…

00:47:07:10

Oleg: So, do we have any clue what coordinate it is that they want? …This project is probably //designed…

Ashley //My team has left me hanging today. 

Salah: Hm?

Ashley: My team is…

00:47:30:11

Ashley: Usually they talk to me a lot, but today…

Oleg: They can’t recover after Christmas.

Ashley: Yes, they are... But I wouldn’t want to do it this week either.

Will: Beep-boop. …[SL] Do you still have the points?

Vika: Hm?

Will: Okay. Cool. 

Ashley: Alright. Let’s see what else there is. 

Vika: What? What do you say?

00:47:59:17

Will: Okay, okay, okay. “[UI]”

Oleg: According to the ideology, how many thousands of people should survive?

Salah: They are saying: “All the good spots seem to be in the upper right corner of the grid”

Ashley: Not for me. 

Salah: Hm.

Vika: Oh.

Oleg: There’s fifty…

00:48:30:19

Oleg: Fifty-one. It’s just great.

Vika: Did you write to drilling?

Will: I will. 

Oleg: What?

Salah: Fifty?

Oleg: Yes, fifty zero one.

Ashley: So, water yield for Project RED should be anywhere from ten thousand to fifty thousand a day. Okay. 

Vika: One more time, please. Fifty…

Oleg: Fifty zero one. 

Ashley: Usability…

Vika: Oh.

00:48:58:28

Ashley: Accessibility ranges from zero to ten thousand. 

Oleg: Here, on the plain, it is generally rocky.

00:49:05:23 – 00:50:32:04

[no audio]

Ashley: My team, apparently, says that all three of initial options that we gave were shut down for various reasons. Do we have any other suggestions?

Oleg: Will, for you, the extreme one, which one is good? Let’s accept it, and that’s it.

Will: Let’s…

Vika: Ten thirty and seven eleven.

Ashley: No, my…

Will: Ten thirty //and seven eleven. I have how much…So, what do we have here?

Ashley: //My team…my team responded to say that seven eleven, ten thirty and nineteen twenty-nine

00:51:02:27

Ashley: are not good for them. For many reasons. They are asking us, //are there any other suggestions.

Will: //Nineteen twenty-nine?

Oleg: Nineteen twenty-nine?

Ashley: They told me no to that one, too.

Will: Nineteen twenty-nine?

Ashley: Yeah, they said, all three of them have been shot down for various reasons.

Will: Okay. How about…

Ashley: What did you think //again about…

Will: //thirty-nine forty-one.

Ashley: Thirty-nine forty-one? Let’s see. 

Salah: Thirty-nine…

00:51:30:28

Oleg: What do you have?

Ashley: No.

Will: No?

Ashley: It would be really high in meteorology costs. It’s a lot of yellow, orange and red zones. 

Oleg: Thirty-nine forty-one?

Ashley: Yes, but//it won’t work at all.

Vika: //What other option did we have, guys?

Ashley: Earlier, we talked a bit about thirty-three eighteen. 

Salah: Hm.

Will: What about fourteen six?

Ashley: Fourteen six?

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: Fourteen six. 

00:52:03:25

Salah: Doesn’t work for me.

Ashley: It’s not bad for me. 

Salah: It’s bad.

Vika: Thirty-three eighteen?

Salah: Fourteen six.

Will: Fourteen six.

Salah: Check twenty-three twenty-three. 

Will: Okay. 

Ashley: Twenty-three twenty-three. …It’s not bad. 

Will: No water. 

00:52:29:20

Ashley: Oh. …What did you guys say about thirteen thirty-eight?

Will: Let me see here. 

Ashley: It’s the one we talked about previously.

Will: Thirteen thirty-eight. Thirteen thirty-eight. It’s not a lot of water but it works. 

00:52:59:14

Ashley: What did you all think //about thirteen thirty-eight?

Vika: //Which point?

Ashley: We already talked about it, but…

Oleg: No. No. Thirteen thirty-eight… Thirteen thirty-eight?

Ashley: Mhm. What about you?

Salah: Which one?

Vika: It’s okay.

Ashley: Thirteen thirty-eight. It’s, like, one that I can work with. It’s not the best for me, but…

Oleg: It’ll do. 

Ashley: It’ll do?

Vika: Yeah, it’s okay. 

Ashley: And Will said there is some water there. What do you think?

00:53:30:07

Ashley: Cause they are asking for other suggestions. So, I thought, maybe we can suggest that.

Salah: [UI]. Okay. 

Ashley: You can just type in. Yeah. 

Will: Thirteen thirty-eight. We already went over it, right?

Ashley: So, what do you think? Should I suggest that one?

Will: Which one?

Ashley: Thirteen thirty-eight. Should I suggest that to them?

Will: I mean, I’ve suggested it to my people.

Ashley: Oh, okay. 

Will: So, I mean, I’ve given them some options. 

Oleg: Well, what?

Ashley: I suggest that they also look at 

00:54:00:00

Ashley: thirteen thirty-eight. Oops.

Salah: Twenty-four thirty-five. 

00:54:36:03

Will: Twenty-four thirty-five – no water. 

Salah: Okay. They gave me three points. It’s okay with them. Forty-five forty-seven, forty-five forty-five, forty-five forty-one. 

Will: Which ones?

Salah: Forty-five forty-seven. This one we checked. We already said…

Ashley: We said, no. 

Will: //Forty-five…it’s okay…

Salah: //Forty-five forty-five

Will: Forty-five forty-five. I haven’t checked that one. 

00:55:01:20

Ashley: My team got back to me with a couple, too. 

Will: Forty-five forty-five.

Ashley: No!

Vika: No!

Ashley:  Forty-five forty-five – no!

Vika: no.

Will: There is no water.

Salah: Okay. Forty-five forty-one. 

Will: okay…Forty-five…let me check. 

Vika: It’s better. 

Will: Forty-five forty-one.

Ashley: Also, no. Would not be great. It’s like…

00:55:29:19

Vika: Okay. And the last point?

Will: There is a decent amount of water there. Hold on. 

Ashley: I mean, if there is a lot of water then I’ll just //up the costs for the meteorology, but…

Will: //Let me…let me…let me…//Let me tun some calculations.

Vika: //Salah, and the last point is?

Salah: Which one you researched?

Vika: Forty-five forty-five, forty-five forty-one.

Salah: The first one we already checked before – forty-five forty-seven.

Vika: The last one.

Salah: Yeah. Forty-five forty-seven.

Vika: Forty-seven.

Salah: We’ve checked before. 

Ashley: My team is also giving me two

00:56:00:20

Ashley: positions. They give twenty-nine…twenty-four…Twenty-four thirty-five.

Oleg: //Twenty-four thirty-five.

Will: //Twenty-four…

Salah: [UI] is saying, twenty-four thirty-five. //drilling specialist.

Ashley: //Yeah. That’s what I said. It’s not bad for me.

Will: Twenty-four thirty-five – there is no water. 

Ashley: Oh. 

Will: What was the other one?

Ashley: The other one is twenty-five thirty-six.

Oleg: Oh. 

00:56:29:16

Oleg: Well, so.

Will: No water. 

Oleg: Average. 

Ashley: Okay. Either of those…

Oleg: What is the other one that you have? The second one?

Ashley: Well, William has already checked that point and said that there’s no water, so.  

00:56:42:25 – 00:57:20:14

[no audio]

Oleg: It’s already been an hour. 

Ashley: [UI]

Will: Twenty-four thirty-five. Did I …yeah, I did.

Ashley: Yeah. You checked that one and said there is no water. I’d say, thirteen thirty-eight looks pretty good if they would get back to us about that.

Vika: It’s okay. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Oleg: Which one did you say?

Ashley: Thirteen thirty-eight. 

Oleg: We already had thirteen thirty-eight.

Vika: Mhm.

00:57:50:29

Ashley: Yes. //We were just checking.

Vika: //We’ve already checked that. 

Salah: I think, all of those points are //[UI]

Ashley: // I think we need to go with that one. 

Oleg: Well, so so – average.

Salah: Materials specialist. 

Ashley: Not the best for me, but it would work.

Oleg: Well, if yes, then…

Ashley: Mhm.

Oleg: So, that means…Sent from the third step. 

00:58:20:03

Oleg: Wow. I have it. Fifty…

Salah: What did they say? When you make the [UI] round to them regarding the…last [UI] they said, no coffee and no chocolate after eight. 

Ashley: Yeah, but I…That’s because they were looking at different instructions. But with the SonoTouch we can’t have it after twelve. With the devices that they put on us. 

Salah: Hm.

Vika: But we can pretend that you didn’t hear that.

Ashley: No, no, no. You heard it. You heard it from me. 

00:58:51:29

Salah: There is no document. 

Vika: Clever balls. 

Oleg: Thirteen thirty-eight - 40% loss. We can take a risk. 

Ashley: Oops.

Vika: It’s mine. 

00:59:20:23

Oleg: What fell to the ground…is lost forever. 

Ashley: There is clarification at [SL] MD fifty-five in the cyclogram. 

Vika: Oh, really?

Salah: Hm?

Oleg: What? Fifty-five?

Vika: Is it a new one?

Oleg: What are you doing?

00:59:51:08

Oleg: //At research?

Vika: Yeah, really. Is it a new one or from tomorrow?

Ashley: They gave a radiogram about…They gave a radiogram about it, so…

Salah: They said: “Yes, we can”.

Ashley: I mean, they are adding stuff for fifty-five. Apparently 16J [UI]. Okay. 

Vika: Oh, okay.

Ashley: [UI]. I don’t know [UI]

01:00:35:11

Vika: Do you have any response?

Will: No. I mean, they are…. I told them…They said they were looking at twenty-four thirty-five, and that was bad, no water. 

Oleg: Will we have echography tomorrow, too?

Vika: Yes.

Ashley: Yes.

Vika: And on day eight. On day eight?

Oleg: //First and second day? Two days in a row?

Salah: //Whom they sent twenty-four thirty-five?

Will: I think, you. 

Vika: Two days in a row and then after one more day.

01:01:00:13

Salah: They offered it. Not me. 

Oleg: So, twenty-one zero four?

Ashley: //But we had it already.

Salah: They are looking at //twenty-four thirty-five.

Vika: //Yes, we had it already. 

Oleg: At twenty-one zero four, you will be the operator. 

Ashley: Me?

Oleg: Mhm.

Ashley: For echography?

Oleg: Yes…. Together with twenty one zero three, during the survey twenty one zero five and twenty one zero four.

Vika: Well, in… in the instructions it says that

01:01:30:09

Vika: We can ourselves. The way we did it today. //It was distributed very well.

Ashley: //I think we did well today. 

Vika: Yeah, yeah. 

Ashley: figuring out. Well, //with getting everything done

Vika: //Yeah, I think it went good.

Salah: //Yeah.

Oleg: Has anyone written to you?

Ashley: What?

Oleg: Letter.

Ashley: Not today. 

Oleg: Now? What is it there?

Vika: Why?

Ashley: No, these are more, radiograms. 

Oleg: You must have gotten on the nerves of everyone out there.

Vika: //Did you check?

Ashley: //The team is not talking to me today. I didn’t receive any new letters…

Vika: Come on! I sent you the video.

01:01:59:12

Ashley: Oh, yeah. Yeah. That was pretty funny. 

Oleg: They are all tired of you. 

Ashley: How can it be?

Oleg: You see it yourself. 

Vika: So, which point we chose?

01:02:31:28

Vika: Hm? Thirteen thirty-eight?

Ashley:  I think we should just go with thirteen thirty-eight.

Oleg: Oh. Thirty…twenty-four thirty-five. Oh well, we’ve already looked. 

01:03:00:02 – 01:03:24:06

[no audio]

Ashley: [SL] I guess, it’s time. 

01:03:30:21 – 01:04:18:26

[no audio]

Oleg: How long do we have this rubbish for?

Ashley: What?

Vika: Seventeen forty. 

Oleg: No, exactly this one. When will we switch to text messages? 

Ashley: Text messages? What’s that?

Oleg: Well, e-mail. Well, when it is all here.

Ashley: Oh. During Relay. I was like…sorry. I don’t know. They…they always start it at Sign Off. So…

01:04:50:04

Will: Thirty-nine forty-one? Did that work for us?

Oleg: Okay. Thirty…

Ashley: Thirty-nine forty-one?

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: I’m about to see. 

Vika: No. 

Will: No? Why not?

Ashley: Yeah. There is a lot of yellow, orange and red zones. 

Vika: Because the…the…the…

Ashley: And lots of mountains, icecaps, craters. 

Vika: Water loss is high in this place.

Ashley: Very difficult location. 

01:05:19:17

Ashley: High meteorology costs. 

Oleg: //A hard-to-reach point.

Vika: //[UI]

Oleg: It doesn’t open. The hard-to-reach point is not opening. 

Salah: You said, thirteen forty-one? Huh?

Ashley: He said, thirty-five…

Salah: Thirty-five?

Ashley: Thirty-nine forty-one, he said. 

Will: Yeah. 

Salah: Check thirteen forty-one. 

Will: Thirteen forty-one?

Salah: Yes.

01:05:50:20

Salah: And tell me there is no water. 

Will: There is a lot of water there. 

Ashley: It’s not bad for me either. 

Vika: Okay.

Will: Okay. 

Ashley: Salik said thirteen forty-one.

Salah: Forty-one. 

Vika: High level of contamination there. Sorry, guys. 

Will: At…at…

01:06:20:03

Will: What do you mean?

Vika: Thirteen forty-one?

Will: Yes.

Vika: The level of contamination is very high there. 

Oleg: Yes.

Will: What does it mean?

Vika: It means that contamination is high and…

Oleg: I have seventy, if not more, percent…

Will: But there is so much…It’s a hundred and eighteen //it’s more…

Ashley: //Oh, my God! My team just said: “We only have one minute, so let’s go with twenty-four thirty-five.” You just said there is no water there. 

01:06:49:29

Will: I mean…

Ashley: “We have one minute, so, we are going with twenty-four thirty-five.”

Will: I mean, alright. 

Oleg: Agreed? Agreed?

Will: Okay. 

Vika: Very high level of water loss.

Will: There is…

Salah: Twenty-four thirty-five?

Ashley: That’s what they are going with. 

Will: I mean, there is no water. 

Salah: [UI]

Will: What was it? Twenty-four thirty-five?

Ashley: That’s what they are saying. Yeah. 

01:07:22:22

Vika: Why can’t we choose?

Ashley: Yeah.

Will: I think that //that’s the structural geologist.

Salah: //It’s twenty-four thirty-five? It’s really bad for me. The depth is three kilometers. \

Ashley: I’m going to write that. “It’s also three kilometers in depth, according to our materials specialist.”

Oleg: Yes. 

Ashley: “Very, very deep”. I’m gonna say, “horrible decision!”. I’m just kidding. 

Salah: Yeah. Five…

01:07:52:20

Oleg: Salya, you will spend too long there…

Salah: [UI]

Oleg: Only on the materials there, we will go broke. Three thousand. The mine is so...

Salah: Three kilometers. I think, this is the only point that has three kilometers. 
Ashley: Of course, they picked that one. 

01:08:23:11

Ashley: Dummies. 

Oleg: Salya, everyone is ignoring you. Keep working! 

01:08:50:19

Oleg: Well, what do you say?

Ashley: I wrote to them to say it was a very bad decision. 

Vika: They took offense and are no longer talking to you. 

Oleg: They didn’t want to talk to you that much to begin with. And now they have no desire at all to talk to you. They will say: “What did we write to her for?”

Salah: Which point we agreed on?

Ashley: Well, they agreed. //On twenty-four thirty-five.

Salah: //Why am I following them, they should follow us!

Ashley: We should ask them that, actually. 

01:09:21:10

Salah: We don’t need to go into Signoff. They are going to choose twenty-four thirty-five.

Ashley: What’s this person saying?

Vika: Twenty-four thirty-five – it’s what we’ve checked or…yes. 

Will: Yes. 

Ashley; Well…

Salah: And I’m telling them…oh, you see?

Will: I mean, there is nothing we can do. If they are going with it they’ll go with it.

Vika: Drilling specialist sent a message.

Ashley: I think we should ask about why they don’t…Why we can’t be the choosers of the point. 

Will: That’s a function of the program. They programmed that in…that’s someone…

01:09:51:20

Ashley: Well, I mean, like, even when we give them a point and they discuss it, why is it their final decision, and they don’t come back to us with reasons. We give them reasons, of like, “this is good because of this, and this isn’t good because of this…”. And I feel like, they just say, like, “Okay. That doesn’t work for us”. And that’s it. 

Will: That’s what we do, but…I mean, I think they just built it in just to make it more complicated. Okay.

Ashley: Are they gonna put it in the signoff or not?

01:10:20:03

Will: I don’t know. I’m wondering if structural geologist needs to be able to do something and he can’t. Cause his computer is down. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Oleg: Where? They were saying there was only one minute – that’s it. 

Vika: Are you in a hurry to get somewhere?

Oleg: Yes, I already want…

Vika: You have letters there…

Oleg: What?

Vika: You have letters unanswered there.

Oleg: Yes. Well, there’s some dynamics at least. Well, this is just great. 

01:10:51:13

Oleg: I can’t take it anymore. Say, apple, do we have any left?

Salah: So, we go to sign off?

Oleg: Vika, none left?

Vika: We have some. Will, can you please pass an apple, behind you, if it’s not too difficult. 

Will: What?

Vika: Please pass an apple, behind you. …Thank you.

Will: Quickly.

Salah: [SL] Not ideal.

01:11:22:18

Will: I mean, it’s tough but they are…

Oleg: a horribly boring task. 

Vika: Well, it is indeed somewhat boring today.

Oleg: Thank you. 

01:11:51:20

Vika: No. …Forgive me, please. I [UI] you. Please forgive me. 

01:12:19:18

Vika: What?

Ashley: Sorry. 

Vika: Oh.

Oleg: It’s an apple for Adam.

Vika: Ooh. Hey, stop it. We just cleaned it here. Come on!

Oleg: This apple…

Salah: It’s recording the video, huh?

Ashley: I forgot. 



01:12:54:17

Ashley: It’s like back to kindergarten.

Oleg: Ho do you…which one do you…

Ashley: We are playing…We [UI] such…

Vika: Who wants?

Ashley: [UI]

Salah: Thank you. 

Vika: Be careful. Will, an apple?

Will: Mhm-m. 

Vika: Salah?

Oleg: Pointing a knife at the screen! 

01:13:30:01

Oleg: What point did we agree on?

Vika: Thirteen thirty-eight. 

Ashley: [UI]

Will: Okay. They said, thirty-eight…Thirteen thirty-eight for signoff.

Ashley: Oh! Finally! Yes! 

Vika: Hm?

Ashley: [UI]. Okay. Okay.

Vika: Thirteen thirty-eight?

Ashley: Yeah. They actually went with that. 

Vika: Perfect. 

Ashley: Good. Okay, I agree. 

Oleg: I’ll choose the filters now and ... That’s it, let’s stop there, right?

Ashley: [UI]

01:14:00:20

Oleg: And let’s all go and have some rest. So, this//[UI]

Ashley: //[UI]

Oleg: [SL] Small…

Salah: Hm…

Vika: Hm?

Salah: This is good. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Vika: Perfect. 

Oleg: Fifty-two – it is…

01:14:30:00

Ashley: Why can’t I even change my…

Vika: Yeah…I can’t too.

Ashley: Okay, wait. Now we can. Okay. 

Vika: We can?

Ashley: I can, yeah.

Vika: Okay.

Ashley: It’s just slow.

Oleg: Mhm.

Vika: No, I can’t. I think it’s…it’s not my turn or what?

01:15:01:12

Salah: “We are going with thirteen thirty-eight now.”

Ashley: Good. 

Will: Good stuff. This is kind of cool. I mean, it would be kind of cool to be a college kid and then be in a project like this. Although, it would suck to get up that early on your Christmas break. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: Okay.

01:15:43:12

Will: Why did you click?

Ashley: Oh…Yeah.

Vika: [UI]

Ashley: You can’t do that…everyone…gives [UI]

Will: Fuck! 

Ashley: So, we have to reject that.

Will: I got it. 

Ashley: Hydrogeologist

Vika: Hydro what?

01:16:14:17

Will: Then stop it. 

Oleg: Okay. We’ll take thirteen thirty-eight. That’s it, right?

Ashley: Mhm.

Oleg: Done. I have set everything.

Ashley: So, fill in your spot there.

Oleg: I… I already filled out the filters. 

Ashley: Mhm…Hydrogeologist [UI]. Hydro…

Oleg: Why did…why did you press it?

Ashley: Why did you do that? You are not supposed to do that until the end when everybody fills in everything. Damn it! 

01:16:44:21

Oleg: Why can’t I fill it out? //Is somebody filling it out?

Ashley: //Are you rejecting that one?

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: Will, are you…okay.

Oleg: There, now. Hold on, hold on, hold on…

Ashley: Good job. 

Will: Did it come through?

Ashley: No, I think he unclicked it…

Salah: Yeah.

Ashley: He unclicked it before it came through. What did you write?

Will: “Chill, bro. [SL] Add material.” [SL] And she wouldn’t let me reject it.

01:17:21:10

Vika: This is a very strange [UI]

Ashley: It’s not bad. It’s a different texture than the other ones, I think. A little bit. 

Will: Oleg, what are you doing?

Oleg: I am all done.

Ashley: You can’t turn it off yet! 

Oleg: Why?

Ashley: I mean, seriously. Because everyone needs to add them…

Oleg: Well, okay. I have added. 

Ashley: [UI]

Oleg: See?!

Ashley: Now I see. 

01:17:50:13

Oleg: Ash, be more attentive. 

Ashley: There was a pause here. 

Oleg: Be more attentive. 

Vika: Hm.

Salah: I can’t pick.

Vika: Can you see the point? Can’t see it either. 

Ashley: It will probably up to a week…till Sunday. 

Oleg: Where shall we  //send [SL] fifty. 

Will: //Can you put it there? No?

Vika: Last time I…Oh, it’s like, down? No, I can’t. No. 

Ashley: My lips are very dry.

Oleg: Go get a lipstick. 

01:18:21:12

Ashley: What?

Oleg: Go get a lipstick. 

Vika: Mhm-m.

Ashley: Is everybody done?

Will: Okay.

Vika: I can’t see anyone. 

01:18:45:17

Vika: I can’t see the point either. 

Oleg: [SL] Human out all these…materials put them, [UI] - yes; I – yes; mechanic – yes. Only structural geologist…

Ashley: Alright. So, we just need structural geologist, which he probably can’t…and sedimentologist. //We need your stuff in there. 

Salah: //[UI]

01:19:17:08

Will: I mean, I can’t.

Vika: I see nothing.

Salah: Why you can’t?

Vika: Yeah, I can’t…

Will: It doesn’t allow me to do anything. 

Ashley: Do you usually have a [SL] dropdown? Or do you just enter stuff?

Will: I mean, it normally just populates it. 

Ashley: And you don’t…is it not your team that usually populates it? Because…

Will: Well, struct //geo has to…I think, struct geo is like…

Vika: //Please show me the point.

Oleg: Point?

Vika: Oh, you can’t see it either.

Oleg: Here it is. 

Ashley: //You can’t figure that out from the notes? Or I don’t know if there is something. 

Vika: //No, no, no. At [UI]. Okay.

01:19:50:21

Will: We don’t normally //have to. I normally just close it.

Oleg: //Do you mean, is it marked – is it not marked? 

Vika: Can you enter? No? I can’t see any marked ones.

Oleg: Can you write?

Ashley: I have written already. 

Oleg: Is that it?

01:20:24:07

Oleg: Look, do I have it written down or not?

Ashley: Yes. I have it written down.

Oleg: It’s only three points that have been received. They are not giving more. 

Ashley: Are you letting them know?

Will: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 

Ashley: What’s happening?

Will: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 

01:21:00:09

Will: I’m able to alter something. That’s weird.

Vika: Can you go up to the very top, please? …No, you can’t see it either. 

Oleg: Do you want to see the specific coordinates to understand?

Vika: The coordinates and the people that added them.

01:21:30:00

Oleg: Nobody has added them yet. They’ve added information. I see all the information that they added, but nobody has…We’re waiting for the confirmation.

Will: Okay. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

Oleg: There, now only William will give his.

Will: Hold on, hold on. 

Oleg: Then the geologist, the hydrogeologist…

Will: [SL] Notes.

Oleg:  and the engineer. Just now, only the calculations for now…

01:22:00:14

Will: [SL] Drag…Okay, what does this say? It’s saying… ‘Yeah, you guys need to drag and drop location [UI] into the Signoff sheet”. Okay.

Oleg: [SL] Why are you crawling around there? You have a different task. 

Ashley: We have three. Some…

01:22:30:29

Will: //Got’em! Hold on. Hold on. 

Vika: //[SL] Give me your pen.

Ashley: Twenty-five [UI]

Vika: Do you have a pen? Give me a pen please.

Will: Boom! Got it!

Ashley: What do you mean?

Salah: What?

Vika: What? What?

Ashley: You got it working //or what?

Will: //Take a look.

Ashley: How did you get it working?

Vika: Oh, yeah!

Will: He said. He told me how. You have to drag and drop. 

Vika: You have to what?

Ashley: Oh, from the right side?

Will: Yeah.

Oleg: So what? //Can this be…

Will: //I had to make the calculation and then put it in there. 

Oleg: Can we confirm?

Ashley: Yes, I think we can.

Oleg: Everyone has entered. 

Ashley: Everything is there already, so…

Oleg: Yes. 

01:22:59:18

Ashley: Yes. 

Oleg: I am putting it in. I will not block anyone?

Ashley: No. 

Oleg: Yes. Darn!

Salah: They signed off. You also?

Ashley: [SL] We can, too. Oh, it didn’t get through?

Oleg: Why isn’t anyone giving anything?

Ashley: [UI]

01:23:31:25

Oleg: [UI]. Oh, Salya…

Salah: Hm?

Ashley: I don’t know where mine is.

Oleg: There, we have everything.

Salah: Why is it not clicking?

Oleg: Oh, the meteorologist is slow again. 

Ashley: Okay.

Oleg: So…fuel engineer, we have it here. Material we have.

Ashley: I had to do mine three times too. 

01:23:58:10

Salah: Why is it not clicking?

Ashley: Hmm…

Will: I see you…Just…

Salah: See?

Will: Yeah, click it. Yes. Don’t touch it. 

Ashley: Now it works. 

Salah: Now it works. Fifth time.

Ashley: Yeah.

01:24:36:26

Ashley: Where is my maintenance specialist?

01:34:39:24 – 01:35:09:11

[no audio]

Ashley: I’m literarily waiting for my maintenance specialist. 

Salah: Hm.

Ashley: Okay. I need to Sign off. 

Will: Mhm. We just need maintenance and then we’re good to go. 

Ashley: So, I’m going to [UI]

Will: Press that “Like”. 

01:25:31:23

Oleg: Chickened out, didn’t you?

Salah: Where is this going? Maintenance specialist. 

Vika: Interesting. 

01:25:54:26 – 01:26:29:16

[no audio]

Salah: Where is this guy?

Vika: Okay.

Oleg: Damn. 

Salah: [SL] What is it? I will write to them. 

01:27:03:03 – 01:27:23:20

[no audio]

Ashley: Are we still waiting for them?

Vika: Yes. 

Will: Mhm.

Vika: No, we are waiting for you. 

Salah: “We are waiting for you. Can you //[UI]

Ashley: //Be, like, “[SL] Add maintenance specialist [UI]

Will: They are probably smashing them right now. Let’s see here. Robotics…

Ashley: That’s my own team member. 

Vika: Mhm.

Will: Oh, specimen factors…

01:27:59:14

Vika: I know who I will mention in today’s questionnaire. Mhm-mm. 

Will: Come on, maintenance! Where you at, boy?

Ashley: We still have the Relay task. 

01:28:31:18

Vika: Maybe, we can start the next thing? Oh no, we should still do some questionnaire. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: Mhm.

Ashley: Can we start the questionnaire, maybe?

Vika: Let’s do that. 

Ashley: DeChurch nine. Shall we start?

Vika: Let’s start.

Will: Just don’t close the camera. 

Vika: Hm. DeChurch…

Will: Nine, is it?

Vika: Mhm.

01:28:59:29

Salah: We close the camera?

Ashley: No.

Vika: No,

Will: No.

Salah: Why did you close it?

Ashley: I didn’t close it. 

Salah: You closed it. 

Ashley: I did not close it. It’s still there. 

Salah: What is the time?

Will: Oh!

Ashley: I have two different ones. I closed it earlier, remember?

Salah: Okay. 

Ashley: So, this one is at forty-one minutes. 

Salah: Ah, okay. I thought the time is here. 

Ashley: Alright. I’m doing my survey. 

01:29:31:02

Will: No news from them. 

Vika: Hm?

Ashley: Alright. DeChurch nine. Let’s go. …Maybe they are all on Relay task and are waiting for us. 

Oleg: Did we decide not to wait?

Ashley: [UI]

Salah: [UI]

Ashley: What? Oh…

01:29:59:19

Ashley: Wait, what are you doing? No. It’s DeChurch nine right now. 

01:30:04:00 – 01:30:37:23

[no audio]

Vika: Who is Salya in Russian? Operations? Materials? Material specialist? Okay. 

01:31:03:03

Will: I guess…Yeah, let’s do this and then just open up the other one. Okay. 

01:31:10:12 – 01:31:58:24

[no audio]

Oleg: The tenth too, yes?

Ashley: DeChurch nine. Mhm. 

Oleg: No, ten. 

Ashley: Nine first. 

Will: [UI]

Ashley: Ten.

Oleg: I’ve done everything. 

Ashley: What? Ten after the Relay task. 

Oleg: Yes, okay. This should have been done after it, too. 

01:32:20:00 – 01:32:53:13

[no audio]

Vika: Back [UI]. To the question “Who didn’t you like?” I would say the guy that did not mark it. 

Will: What?

Vika: There is a question “Who didn’t you like?”. I should have said the guy that did not put a check mark. 

01:33:09:10 – 01:33:23:24

[no audio]

Oleg: Vika, you had it right in Russian – is it geology or…

Vika: Yes, geologist. 

Oleg: Geologist. 

01:33:35:25 – 01:33:52:24

[no audio]

Will: Mhm. Okay, yeah. They just said that they are not able to get the maintenance specialist to sign off. Something is wrong with it. And…so they are gonna screenshot all the data, and then put it in later. But yeah…So, we just should do our survey and then we’ll go to the Relay task. 

Vika: Okay. 



01:34:11:29 – 01:35:00:16

[no audio]

Vika: What are these noises? Such strange noises.

Oleg: It’s the cargo carrier docking.

01:35:11:28 – 01:39:07:03 

[no audio]

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: I’d love some coffee now. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Vika: I would go for a swim in coffee. 

Oleg: Damn, it’s something else there. These…

Vika: Do you want me to do it for you?

01:39:31:14

Oleg: Are you done?

Vika: Yes. Please don’t beat me up. 

Ashley: I’m done too. Have you finished yet?

Vika: Mhm. 

Oleg: There’s an end there. The most important thing for me is to understand.

Vika: We all have an end. 

Oleg: I think the questionnaires are endless. 

01:40:01:29

Oleg: People don’t live that long, damn. …it’s just [UI]. Read the same questionnaires and look for some meaning in them.

01:40:33:10

Oleg: It’s just the first one. How many sections are there?

Vika: Five. I’m kidding, Oleg. Fill it out, fill it out. 

Oleg: Is there an end to it, do you know?

Ashley: God…

Salah: DeChurch ten we do it after the second?

Ashley: Mhm. 

Will: Mhm.

01:41:16:15

Salah: Should we log out, Will?

Will: No, you’re gonna…once you’re done with the survey, you’re gonna have to…I mean, you can keep that open or not keep it. It doesn’t matter.

Ashley: He means Project RED.

Salah: No. Project RED.

Will: Yeah. That’s what I’m saying. You can keep it or not keep it. It doesn’t matter. What matters is opening the other one – Project RED Design. Not Design –// Relay. 

Ashley: //Relay. 

Vika: Oh, I can’t get up. 

01:41:44:28

Vika: Oh. Oh. Oh, poor old grandma. 

Salah: Until you finish, and we come back. 

Oleg: Which one are you? The ninth or the tenth?

Ashley: What?

Oleg: You are doing

Ashley: The ninth. The tenth should be done after the Relay. 

Oleg: Okay. I did this one at least. 

01:42:10:27 – 01:42:22:21

[no audio]

Oleg: [UI]

01:42:25:24 – 01:42:44:09

[no audio]

Ashley: Oh my God! 

Oleg: What?	

Ashley: Holy shit! There is…

Oleg: Have you done it?

Ashley: No! I haven’t even done 50%. 

Will: I’m on the half of mine now, but I feel like it speed up after that. 

Ashley: Does it?

Will: If I remember correctly. 

Oleg: What section are you doing?

Ashley: Just now [UI] only started.

Oleg: Oh…Well, it’s the end already. 

Ashley: [UI]

Oleg: Will survive. 

01:43:17:13

Oleg: Keep working. 

Ashley: How can I be working if I have…[UI]

Oleg: I don’t understand, are we waiting for something for the Project itself?

Ashley: [UI]

Oleg: They all…Only the maintenance specialist didn’t mark…

Will: For some reason, they were unable to do it. They didn’t say what had happened, but…

01:43:45:19

Oleg: Oh, they’ve written to you, yes?

Will: Mhm. 

Ashley: [UI]

Will: They will…they’ll take screenshots of everything. We won’t need to think what’s there. 

Oleg: So, it turns out that one specialist isn’t there, and they cannot close the program. It’s annoying. The whole project is gone.

Will: Well, they got the information after all. They can put it in the system.

01:44:28:05

Oleg: Are we moving on to the second phase?

Will: Okay, okay. Excellent. There.
