Vika: Picture too?

Will: Phone.

Ashley: Yeah, yeah. I’m [UI]. All right, a trial. They want a new trial.

Vika: Ha-ha.

Ashley: Today is February 24th, 2022. It’s mission day 112. The time is 3:33 pm. Three, two, one...

Will, Ashley, Vika, Oleg, Salah: Mark.

Vika: Why... why don’t we say “Boo”? 

Salah: Yeah. Ha-ha. I like it.

00:00:30:10

Vika: One, two, three – Boo.

Will: // Boo. But it’s a good question.

Vika: // Ha-ha. 

Oleg: // [UI, whispering]

Ashley: I don’t know. Ha-ha. I don’t know about that, Vika.

Vika: Why not? 

Ashley: I don’t know, Ivan even once told me that I... because I accidentally counted upwards, like “one, two, three instead of three, two, one.” He was like, “Actually, Ashley, it really needs to be three, two, one.” Ha-ha. I was like...

Vika: // Okay.

00:01:00:14

Ashley: // Is there... is there a difference really?

Vika: All right. Three, two, one – Boo.

Ashley: Boo. Boo. All right.

Vika: Boo.

Ashley: Um, all right.

00:01:14:00 – 00:01:39:00

[no audio]

Ashley: I wish remembered where the Russian letters were on this keyboard without the letters. Ha-ha.

Vika: Ha-ha.

Will: Boo.

00:02:53:00 – 00:02:58:00

[no audio]

Vika: Guys, we need chat.

Ashley: Shoot, and we… I don’t feel like working. Shoot.

Vika: Boo.

Oleg: Is it not responding?

Will: Boo.

Ashley: // I just can’t select anything, as it usually happens to you.

Vika: // Ha-ha.

Oleg: Recommendation: reload.

00:03:28:21

Ashley: Shoot. I don’t want to. I already have several chats here.

Oleg: But you will be able to…

Will: But it will appear once again.

Oleg: Yes.

Vika:  We can create a stinking chat for you, it will be like “boo”. Wonderful! [SL]

Ashley: How do you… how do you usually resolve this?

Oleg: Reloading. Well, exactly...

Ashley: Logout. That’s it. Yes.

Oleg: Yes, yes, yes.

Ashley: Shoot. 

Oleg: So I am not the only one with such back luck here.

Ashley: Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

00:04:02:28

Ashley: Yes, it’s unsuccessful for me. 

Oleg: What is unsuccessful for you?

Ashley: No, wrong word. I can’t think of the word I want. Ha-ha.

Vika: Uh, so, uh, I wanted to say, uh...

Ashley: Shoot. А-a-а-а.

Vika: What? Did you pass your bad luck to her, or what?

Ashley: // And now…

Oleg: What, my bad luck to her? 

Will: Is it me?

Oleg: What are you talking about? What bad luck? Did I only have good fortune?

00:04:29:13

Ashley: Okay. And now, my map. Now I have my map with a lot of red dots. Ha-ha. What happened here?

Will: Are you sure you didn’t hit your head on the computer?

Vika: Boo.

Oleg: Indeed.

Ashley: Shoot.

Vika: Oh well, it happens. And why don’t we…

Oleg: Okay, guys, can you look at 21-6?

Will: 21-6.

Ashley: I also have a suggestion.

Oleg: Hold on, hold on. 21-6 is just ideal. Or is it not too deep?
	
00:05:01:29

Will:  No water. No water.

Ashley: Okay.

Vika: // Ideal. No water. Ha-ha.

Ashley: Come on, come on.

Salah: 21-01.

Oleg: 21-01?

Salah: // Ha-ha.

Ashley: // No, come on. 18-35. Ha-ha.

Vika: 21-01 doesn’t work. 18-35?

Salah: I’m saying this ID. Ha-ha.

Will: There’s almost no water at all.

Vika: 18-35?

Ashley: Yes.

Oleg: It’s okay.

Ashley: Wow! Ha-ha.

00:05:32:06

Oleg: But if there’s no water there, sorry.

Ashley: Nobody else?

Oleg: Ha-ha. No support for you? What is there to support, if there’s no water?

Ashley: Maybe, our sedimeniti… sentimilogost… gist. I don’t know, how do I say it in Russian?

Vika: // Semintologist.

Oleg: Sentiminologist.

Vika: Sedi… se-se-se…

00:06:00:18

Oleg: Sedimenologist.

Vika, Ashley: Ha-ha.

Vika: It was your bad luck. 

Ashley: Ha-ha. No.

Vika: Oleg has passed on to all of us, down the chain... 

Oleg: What? 

Vika: ... your bad luck.

Oleg: Bad luck? 

Vika: Boo!

Oleg: Okay. 

Vika: Now you are not lucky, ha-ha.

Will: What?

Ashley: But 18-35.

Will: No water.

Ashley: Oh! You said…

Will: I already said that, but…

00:06:29:24

Ashley: I didn’t hear. Shoot.

Salah: 30-16.

Will: Hold on.

Oleg: 30-16.

Will: No water.

Salah: Thank you!

Ashley, Vika, Will: Ha-ha.

Oleg: So, have they completely shut down all the water there?

Will: Yes, no water at all.

Vika: Boo!

00:07:00:24

Vika: How can we live there? Can I live a good life?

Will: No.

00:07:06:00 – 00:07:34:11

[no audio]

Will: Mmm.

Ashley: Oh!

Will: 7-12.

Ashley: 7-12. 

00:07:58:29

Ashley: But yes, not even…

Vika: Very much, I… high level of contamination, if you can?

Oleg: // Yes.

Will: There’s a lot of water there.

Oleg: A-a-a-a, okay. [sigh]

Ashley: // Maybe, only for me it will be…

Salah: // 30-19?

Will: // 7-12.

Oleg: In short, up to 60% loss, but we can filter it.

Will: It is, yes, // but it’s good, but…

Ashley: // I like it, too.

Will: It’s…

Ashley: It will be more expensive.

Salah: // Perfect for me.

Will: // Okay, good. There’s a lot of water there. But still, it is…

Vika: And water loss?

00:08:29:19

Will: Uh, 50%. So, it’s okay. There’s 220, uh…

Vika: Oh, say again. Was it 8-12 there?

Will: 7-12.

Salah: Go ahead, for this part.

Will: Okay. I’ll say that it’s... it’s one that we can...

Vika: 7-12.

Oleg: Okay, shall we keep it then, yes? Okay... 

00:08:59:13

Oleg: And you, when you do it, you immediately make your corrections in the parameters on the right, on the right...

Will: We don’t need to do it. It is calculated for us, it’s so easy for us. We don’t have to select anything. It’s just calculated for us.

Oleg: I don’t. Well, here it is, for each, I just mark it for myself, I set which filter is best for me for this point.

00:09:39:20

Ashley: What do you guys think of 9-39?

Will: 9-39. No water.

Ashley: All right. // Ha-ha.

Vika: // Nice try!

Oleg: Satisfied!

00:09:58:25

Ashley: No. Ha-ha.

Vika: [UI]

Will: Hmm.

Oleg: Why did you suggest 7-12, if there’s nothing there? Oh, no, 7-12. Okay. It’s okay.

00:10:26:00 – 00:11:23:07

[no audio]

Oleg: Oh, excellent! Mm, 47-48.

Ashley: 47-48. [UI] Ha-ha.

Oleg: Outside the boundaries…

Ashley: Ah!

Oleg: To the right.

Ashley: Hmm.

Vika: Which one, again?

Oleg: 47-48. Why are you grimacing?

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Vika: Check 8-33, please.

Oleg: Uh-huh.

Will: 47-48.

Oleg: Yes.

00:12:00:13

Will: 100% water loss.

Oleg: Enough grimacing, shoot. Okay, which one did you say?

Vika: Ah, 8-33.

Will: Which one did you say?

Vika: 8-33.

Ashley: Not bad.

Will: 8-33.

Oleg: It’s a bit too deep, isn’t it? [sigh] You’ll say it yourselves.

Will: Not bad.

00:12:31:17

Oleg: In principle, yes. 10% water loss.

Ashley: I’ll say 33 for you.

Oleg: Uh-huh. 

Salah: Check.

Ashley: Yeah.

Vika: I think it’ll do it.

Oleg: Salah, okay?

Salah: Yeah. It’s okay.

Will: Yes, a lot of water.

Oleg: We also have a lot.

Will: It’s great.

Oleg: Okay, it’s here. So, it turns out it’s better than the previous one. Well, according to my… 

00:13:01:14

Oleg: Okay, “A”.

Ashley: Why is my team not responding?

Will: You haven’t sent them a reminder yet.

Vika: They don’t want to talk to you.

Ashley: But why?

Vika: But I wanna.

00:13:28:08

Ashley: I really want to meet all of them. Ha-ha.

Oleg: But it’s also not too deep, 46-8.

Ashley: 46-8. [UI].

00:13:58:05

Salah: Check 29-29.

Ashley: 46-8 is not better, but not that one either, it’s not there anymore [SL].

Will: 100% water loss.

Ashley: Did you check Oleg’s? 

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: It’s 46-8.

Will: 47-48?

Ashley: 46-8.

Will: I will now. Hold on.

Salah: 46.

Will: 46-48, yes?

Oleg: Uh-huh.

Ashley: No, just... Oh, 48?

Oleg: Forty-six – forty… hmm, forty-six – eight.

00:14:30:18

Will: Forty... forty-six – eight.

Oleg: Yes.

Will: But 46-48 is okay, too. But not as great, but it’s…

Salah: Okay, yes.

Will: 46-8. 

Ashley: Uh-huh.

Will: No water.

Ashley: Shoot. Ha-ha.

Oleg: And, did you say you like the 46-48 you mentioned?

Will: Well, it’s not very good. But at least there there’s a bit of water.

Ashley: Ha-ha.

00:15:04:00

Salah: 14-41.

Vika: 14...

Will: What is it? 14...

Salah: 41.

Vika: No.

Ashley: Empty for me.

Vika: A lot of contaminations. 

00:15:30:21

Will: There is water, there is a good amount of water there.

Vika: Oleg, please check 14-41.

Oleg: Uh-huh.

Salah: [UI] for us.

Ashley: It’s [yawning] it’s 50/50.

Will: It’s, it has water, it’s not, uh... it’s, it’s, it’s a decent amount of water.

Salah: Yeah. 

Will: All right.

Oleg: There’s no water. It is, it’s 60% loss due to additional filters. 

00:16:01:16

Oleg: Murky contamination. But it can be filtered.

Will: 4... 4-23 they say.

Vika: Losses.

Oleg: 4-23.

Ashley: Ho-ho. Not bad.

Vika: It’s okay.

00:16:30:07

Oleg: Okay 47, yes, everything is okay. 10% ha-ha, it’s deep! Oleg will now say…

Salah: // Too deep.

Ashley: Too deep?

Oleg: Well, the depth is 3600.

Salah: Yeah.

Oleg: We are somewhere at 1000, I am thinking whether or not to give 1200. And here we have 3600.

Ashley: There is three thousand six hundred?

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: Shoot.

Oleg: It’s very expensive.

Salah: Yes.

Ashley: Too deep…

Oleg: It’s difficult. 

Ashley: ... according to our // [UI].

Will: There’s also 94 water loss there, even though there’s a lot of water there, hmm.

00:16:59:25

Ashley: How much water are you losing?

Will: 94%.

Oleg: But the water is clean.

Ashley: Is it in depth 3600 – in feet, sorry or is it meters, or?

Salah: It’s not our mission. 

Ashley: Ah! Ha-ha.

00:17:16:00 – 00:19:32:13

[no audio]

Ashley: Mechanical engineer says the 7-12 that we suggested has little water, so it’s not great for them. But you said there is a lot water?

Will: I mean, they might have different calculations.

Ashley: Ah! 

00:20:05:25

Oleg: And here it is, 35-35. Good numbers and a very good location. I hope there is water.

Ashley: What? Say again. Ha-ha. What?

Oleg: 35-35.

Ashley: 35-35.

00:20:30:01

Oleg: 35 was given.

Vika: Did you just like the number?

Oleg: Ha-ha. I liked the parameters.

Vika: Boo.

Oleg: You go take a look, where is it? It’s practically on… on the plain.

Ashley: [sigh].

Oleg: Why are you being difficult?

Ashley: I am not… ha-ha.

Vika: It’s bad in terms of the water basin area. 
 
00:20:59:22

Vika: It’s okay in terms of contamination.

Will: Which one?

Vika: // 35-35. 

Oleg: // 35-35.

Will: No water.

Vika: Boo. Great [UI]

00:21:31:14

Oleg: What parameter is not here? It’s the presence of water.

Ashley: Ah, shit!

Oleg: No swearing.

Ashley: Ha-ha. [UI] one person.

Vika: How do you say it in Russian?

Ashley: Ah! Is it “fuck”? Ha-ha. Don’t listen to it, cover your ears.

00:22:01:13

Oleg: Why? What are you learning?

Salah: So, which one we agreed, guys?

Will: // We haven’t agreed.

Ashley: // We haven’t yet.

Salah: Huh?

Will: We haven’t yet.

Salah: 7-12 we, uh, who said that we have...?

Ashley: They, they came back to us, saying that, uh, it’s little water, so it’s not great for them.

Vika: What about 8-33?

Ashley: I think, didn’t...

Will: 8-33.

Ashley: ... didn’t, didn’t we say that sucks?

Will: No, that’s okay. 

Ashley: Oh, that’s okay? Let’s suggest that then.

00:22:29:29

Will: I’ve suggested it already but.

Vika: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it.

Salah: I see, that’s okay. Not ideal.

Will: Yeah.

Salah: Ask the operation specialist.

Will: 23-13. 23-13.

00:23:05:06 ¬

Oleg: Excellent? It’s just perfect.

Vika: It’s okay. 

Ashley: Uh-huh. It’s okay.

Will: Okay. Decent [UI] water.

Oleg: It’s the best one.

00:23:21:00 – 00:24:17:06

[no audio]

Vika: 32-16. 32-16.

00:24:31:08

Ashley: 34-16?

Vika: 2.

Ashley: Ah! 32-16. Sorry.

Will: 32-16.

Vika: Right.

Ashley: Hmm.

Will: Hmm.

Vika: Ahhh!

Ashley: Okay. Mechanical engineer is asking here… about 4-23…

Oleg: // Oh, that’s it, it’s too deep.

Ashley: // …if it’s possible it would be the worst post but it’s possible.

00:25:03:17

Vika: So, they said that it’s too big...

Ashley: Much too deep.

Vika: // Uh, too deep. 

Oleg: // Yes.

Salah: // Yeah.

Ashley: Way, way, way too deep. Like what’s normal for deep, uh, depth? 

Will: 6 inches.

Salah: // 1000.

Ashley: 1000 or less. Ah, they said 8-33 is looking good for them, for...

Salah: Yeah, I said as... uh, I said... the operation specialist, he said it’s okay, but not ideal.

00:25:32:02

Will: Okay. 8-33. 

Salah: Let’s go ahead for 8-33.

Vika: Guys, 16-7.

00:26:05:22

Will: Hmm. Neither bad, nor good. 

Ashley: 8-16, sorry, what?

Vika: 16-7.

Ashley: Ha-ha. I’m clearly not.

Vika: Thank you, Ashley.

Ashley: It’s not you, it’s me, really.

00:26:32:01

Vika: Ha-ha.

Ashley: Oh!

Vika: And how do you say “lame excuse” in English?

Will: Lame excuse?

Vika: Well, yes, it’s like “find a lame excuse”. Well, like, you want to get away with something and you say, well, for example: “It’s not you, it’s me.” It’s a great way out for an ex-boyfriend.

Will: It is, hmm, it’s difficult to mix, it’s, hmm, how do we say it in English?

00:27:08:00

Vika: Did you understand, Ash?

Ashley: Wait, I wasn’t listening.

Vika: Okay.

Will: They, the operation specialist says 8-33.

Vika: Perfect.

Oleg: Yes, we’ve already calculated 8-33.

00:27:34:11

Salah: Fluid engineer is asking me, “Does 8-33 work, uh, works for your team?”

Ashley: Yeah.

Salah: We suggested this point.

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: I mean, they want to verify. And also, they may have heard it from- I’ve suggested that, those two points in the very beginning before they even logged on.

Salah: // Yeah.

00:27:52:00 – 00:28:09:21

[no audio]

Ashley: My personal team is still not responding to me.

Oleg: [UI].

Ashley: What?

Will: They may not be online.

Ashley: Grrr.

Oleg: In short, all of them.

Ashley: No, to this one question, yes. Ha-ha.

00:28:29:00 – 00:28:41:28

[no audio]

Ashley: The chats are getting kinda mixed up, because I’m getting stuff from random people in specific other chats. 

00:28:57:00 – 00:29:19:16

[no audio]

Ashley: Shoot. [whispering]

Will: They are saying 1-20, just in case.

Oleg: Huh?

Will: 1-20.

00:29:41:00

Vika: 1-20?

Will: Yes, but it’s like 96% water loss there.

Oleg: Yes, and it’s deep. It’s three thousand there… three thousand seven hundred, it’s very deep.

00:30:04:00 – 00:30:48:05

Vika: Let’s push for [SL] point 8-33 and move on to the most beautiful part…

Oleg: Yes.

Vika: ... forwarding messages.

Oleg: Do you like forwarding messages best of all?

00:31:01:21

Vika: Uh-huh. I am missing chat.

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Oleg: But there’s at least some meaning in that.

Ashley: Huh? 

Oleg: There at least…

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Vika: Life is meaningless.

Oleg: Ha-ha. Ash, since because you turned, you to me, it doesn’t mean that you… or rather I… I can see that you turned, but it doesn’t mean that you are following the intonation.

00:31:31:15

Ashley: No, not at all. I can look at you and…

Oleg: And not think.

Ashley: Not… ha-ha.

Vika: That’s what it was like when you were giving a lecture on… about Т-34.

Oleg: Ah!

Ashley: Ha-ha. 

Oleg: So, you still have Т-34 in your eyes.

Ashley: Yes. Yes, yes, it’s very interesting.

Vika:  Oh, yes, yes, yes. // But!

Ashley: // Ha-ha. It’s very much so. I [UI] very much.

Oleg: What analogs were there?

Ashley: Analogs?

Oleg: Well, similar things!

00:31:59:25

Ashley: Ah, I don’t know. Ha-ha.

Oleg: You see, where were you looking? What were you listening to?

Vika: Well, figure skating.

Ashley: Ha-ha. Trying to watch figure skating, but it didn’t work.

Vika: You had an unplanned… you had to attend an unplanned lecture.

Oleg: She asked a question herself. And what did it start with?

Ashley: I also didn’t… oh, no, you were watching some movie.

Oleg: Oh! But you asked yourself.

00:32:33:00

Oleg: I give responses on request. Why not.

Ashley: It was about…

Vika: 43-2.

Ashley: 43-2.

Oleg: Oh, it’s almost time.

Ashley: Where is it situated?

Vika: It’s on the right at the bottom.

Ashley: Аh! Ha-ha.

Oleg: What? Is it okay?

Ashley: It’s better.

00:33:01:11

Oleg: It’s okay.

Vika: Will?

Will: What?

Vika: 43-2, ha-ha.

Oleg: And it’s not deep, and…

Will: 43-2?

Vika: Yes.

Will: Darn, 100 percent water loss.

Vika: Darn. You always do it.

Will: Yes, but I’ve already placed 8-33 at…

Vika: Excellent.

Will: So, hmm.

Salah: // [UI].

Vika: // Where, where, where, where? Ah! Can we sign off already?

Oleg: Yes.

Will: Yes.

Ashley: Oh! Ha-ha.

Vika: // Oh, okay!

Salah: // They’ve already agreed on this one.

Ashley: // Ah! Ha-ha. I also… Ha-ha.

Will: // Basically, I mean, it already came back.

Vika: // Oh, of course… of course.

00:33:32:06

Oleg: Very much?

Ashley: Wait, wait, what? I didn’t give my decision, what are you doing?

Vika: Oh, reject, yeah?

Ashley: Yeah, reject that.

Vika: Okay, sorry.

Will: What are you doing?

Vika: I am signing off, because I want to be sending messages already.

Will: Boo.

Ashley: Okay.

Oleg: // Where is the level here?

Ashley: // 8-33. 3-7-6-7. 3-7-6-7. So, I need... 

00:34:08:28

Ashley: Hmm, hmm, hmm. 3-7-6-7.

Vika: You know what I am doing right after the questionnaire [UI].

Will: Yes, I still need to reboot the robot.

Vika: Not interested.

Oleg: Did you work on the atlas today?

Will: No, no, no, no.

Vika: Boo.

Oleg: Just like me, you skipped it.

00:34:31:17

Vika: // Darn.

Will: // Yes, but there’s only one such, they are like cycles [UI] they were very strange today, in fact.

Oleg: // Yes, the thing is that, hmm…

Will: It was like, hmm…

Vika: Of course, it was strange because we didn’t have breakfast.

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Will: Yes, and they put the atlas, but it was during… during, hmm.

Oleg: Breathing?

Will: No, the dinner.

Oleg: And running for me! You were doing that one, and I had to run for Vika.

Will: Yes, yes, yes, strange. Boo.

00:34:59:10

Vika: [humming] Well, what do you have?

Oleg: For some reason, it is not at all collecting for me.

Vika: Boo.

00:35:31:19

Oleg: Uh-huh. So, no one put their check mark yet?

Ashley: Wait, wait.

Vika: Ha-ha.

Ashley: Fuck, why is it so slow?

Oleg: Let me help.

Ashley: Ta-ta-ta. Ha-ha. Okay. I have finished. I am ready.

00:36:02:21

Oleg: Ash, then clarify if we can delete these, the old videos.

Ashley: Uh-huh. Is it already on the server, everything, right?

Oleg: But everything that we had.

Ashley: Yes, you are right. // Yes, yes.

Oleg: // Because they write to me every time that it’s already…

Ashley: I, the last time I actually even a little bit, well, I de… de… deleted?

Oleg: Deleted.

Ashley: Yes. So, yes.

00:36:26:26

Oleg: Because they are already scolding us because yet another video may not get recorded.

Vika: I have… 51, ah, wow! Oh boy! [humming]

00:37:04:26

Oleg: [coughing]

Vika: In reflection? Boo.

Will: Okay, that’s it, ready.

Oleg: Okay, shall we click?

Will: Shoot.

00:37:31:23

Vika: [humming] 

Ashley: Seriously, I just got… literally in the middle of signing off and I got the... the survey.

Will: Hmm.

Vika: Ha-ha.

00:37:46:00 – 00:39:10:25

[no audio]

Will: You are signed off, right?

Oleg: Huh? 

Will: You are signed off?

Oleg: No, they remain.

Will: Wait what?

Salah: Remaining.

Will: Ah, okay, okay. They are waiting there, you are right.

00:39:23:02 – 00:39:49:16

[no audio]

Ashley: I know what I will write.

Will: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Salah: [UI] I think we’ve signed off?

Will: Oh wait, yours is not showing.

Ashley: It’s not showing up anymore?

00:43:03:29

Vika: You liked it so much you couldn’t stop.

Oleg: Yes.

00:43:08:00 – 00:46:56:01

Vika: Darn.

Ashley: For some reason, everything is working so slowly.

Vika: [UI, chewing].

Ashley: What?

Oleg: Yes. Those that have been written slightly, those we can. [chewing]

Ashley: Don’t worry, it doesn’t say there what is written there [chewing].

Vika: It doesn’t say that it’s slightly? Ha-ha.

Oleg: Yes. Ha-ha. Also, the interpretation is generally just some kind of nonsense.

Vika: But you don’t know the classification.
 
00:52:32:01

Oleg: Well, yes.

Vika: Maybe, it’s nonsense. 

Oleg: But at least when you are reading, you are not privy to it. Can’t you see? Keep thinking.

Will: Boo.

00:53:04:00

Oleg: Like a squirrel, you must run around faster, otherwise all the nuts...

Ashley: It’s possible. Ha-ha.

Vika: To live normally.

Ashley: Okay.

Vika: Darn.

Ashley: Finally, I am done.

Oleg: Done? Shall we start the next one?

Vika: Everyone came a long time ago. I wonder who is watching the video, are they watching the video in its entirety or are they just running it through some program that is reading it.

Will: Uh-huh. I don’t know.

Vika: No? Too bad. Because as soon as we turn on Project Red or EDTB [SL], …

Oleg: We eat them.

Vika: … we eat the costs.

Oleg: It, it looks creepy when I decided to look at the video, yes.

Vika: Do you immediately want to eat, too?
