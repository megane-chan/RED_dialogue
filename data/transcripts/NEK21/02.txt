Igor: No, no, seriously. 

Vika: What?

Igor: In English, please.

Vika: Oh, in English? Oh, alright.

Igor: [UI]

Will: Don’t touch the button.

Vika: I am just ready to say it after three.

Igor: No need. //Don’t do anything.

Will: //You don’t touch it. 

00:01:30:04

Ashley: //We are already recording. 

Will: //It’s already turned on.

Vika: Yeah. I know. Oh, okay! Okay, let’s simply have someone // else do it.

All: //Mark!

Vika: Oops. 
00:02:30:00

Igor: Almost perfect. Countdown “three, two, one”. That’s what we’re typically after. But hey…next time.

Vika: One more time?

Igor: No. We’re good. 

Will: Good.

Igor: “Mark” was really good. Okay, so, now bring up the Relay window. The browser with the Project Relay window. It’s already open

Ashley: Okay. 

Igor: And you can maximize that if you want. It’s good. Alright. 

Salah: Should we press [SL] dotted or…

Igor: Hold on. //I’m making sure everybody is ready.

Salah: [UI]

Will: huh?

Salah: Your role.

Oleg: Good?

00:03:00:13

Katya: No, we’re waiting. 

Will: We’re…okay.

Katya: Waiting for everyone to be ready.

Will: Gotcha.

Salah: [SL] this press and wait.

Igor: Just one second.

Will: And wait.

Salah: And wait. 

Igor: Hurry up and wait. 

Salah: And wait. 

Will: It’s going. We’re moving. Everything is good. 

Igor: [SL] What’s in yours?

Ashley: I Just selected my role and…

Vika: Yes. The same.

Igor: You selected your role?

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: Coming.

Oleg: William, you don’t have 

00:03:29:29

Ashley: And it’s loading. 

Will: Not yet. It’s coming.

Oleg: It can’t…

Igor: Oh, wait a little, it’s good. It’s…I’ll tell you what to press next. Until I say something, don’t press anything. 

Vika: Too bad. 

Igor: I will say. 

Will: What do you mean don’t turn off the recorder?... “No, I will press! - No.”

Igor: Okay, press. 


00:04:00:06

Igor: Let’s press. 

Salah: Got it. 

Ashley: Mine is still loading too.

Will: Still the same, yeah.

Vika: So has it started already? We are already choosing whom to send it to.

Igor: One second. // One second. One second. One second. I’m still waiting for a way [UI] here. 

Ashley: //[UI]

Igor: They are slow [SL] typers. 

Will: Okay, I’m in.

Ashley: //I’m still waiting. 

Vika: //[SL] It is okay. 

Will: So, it means it’s coming.

00:04:28:09

Igor: Everybody should be looking at a list of roles eventually. 

Will: Yeah, it will come. It’s just…

Salah: It’s there. 

Will: Mine is there. 

Ashley: Mine is still loading. 

Will: You’re still loading. 

Ashley: Sorry, Abdullah. 

Will: Not touching anything, right?

Igor: We’re not touching anything yet. In the meantime you can //read, look see and think.

Salah: //I’m sorry with you, guys. 

Igor: Okay. Reloading…reloading the page again. 

Ashley: Okay, I’m here.

Igor: They are not seeing you. 

Salah: [UI]

Oleg: The same thing?

00:05:00:08

Igor: Let’s do it this way – in a different way. We will close this page.

Salah: [SL] Meteorologist. Meteorologist. 

Igor: and press…Closing…

Will: That’s me.

Igor: Closing the browser completely.

Will: Completely?

Igor: Only the browser.

Salah: Everything?

Igor: Web browser. Close the web browser, please.

Vika: Here?

Salah: Okay. 

Will: Okay.

Ashley: Okay.

Will: X pressing now. 

Igor: And across the top you’ll see four icons and the last one…on your Desktop. 

Ashley: Mhm.

Salah: Okay.

Igor: The last one is Project RED Relay. 

Ashley: Mhm.

Vika: Right. 

Oleg: RED Relay. 

Salah: Project…Project RED 

Will: But…

Salah: Relay.

00:05:31:02

Igor: Start that and select your roles again. One more time. 

Oleg: Yes.

Igor: So, the thing that happened was that couple of people started early and then they reset there.

Ashley: Alright. 

Igor: Should be fairly //quick this time. 

Ashley: //Okay, that was fast. Yeah. 

Igor: Okay.

Will: This is the Desktop has this…

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: Project RED Relay Designing videos?

Salah: No, no, no. 
Ashley: No, can you…don’t minimize, but …

Igor: //The very last one.

Ashley: //Don’t minimize.

Will: This is the Desktop, so, everything that’s on the Desktop should be here. Right?

Ashley: So, this. Project RED Relay. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Will: This is Relay, right?

Igor: Yeah. 

Will: Okay. 

00:06:01:17

Will: Cool. 

Igor: And stop there. Pick your role.

Will: Once again. 

Salah: Your role, yes. 

Igor: Pick your role and stop. 

Salah: And stop. 

Igor: Is everybody logged in?

Salah: Yeah. 

Igor: And looking at list of roles?

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: Yes.

Igor: Okay.

Salah: Excellent. 

Igor: Wait.

Vika: [SL] One NASA.

Oleg: So, who are we choosing now? [UI]

Katya: We’re not choosing anyone, perhaps. 

00:06:29:18

Vika: Choose me. 

Katya: And all these people here – who are they? //These specialists here.

Will: //We’re not doing anything yet.

Igor: They are twelve people. //In your brochure, all the roles are given on one page. 

Vika: //With who,…

Katya: So, six of them are us, and the other six are…

Igor: Now, we are selecting our contacts.

Will: Okay.

Ashley: Okay. 

Maybe Katya: All twelve are there. 

Igor: Two. Select two people to whom you will be sending messages. 

Will: And “next”? Or wait?

Igor: Select and you can press “next”.

00:07:03:15

Will: Cool. 

Igor: Okay, so, everybody, select two contacts that you would like to relay your messages to. Those will be the only two people that you can send messages to directly…You can see the progress once everyone has done their selections on both sides.

00:07:30:14

Igor: Well, hopefully, advanced team next…Should be…

Will: Beep.

Igor: Alright. …Okay, so, it’s a quick layout. So, there is going to be a message there.

Vika: Nice.

Igor: And you get to send it. You get to select the person you want to send it to. So, at the top you see messages. 

00:08:02:10

Will: This…What is it? This is the tutorial, right?

Vika: How to send messages, right? We are now learning how to send them. 

Igor: It’s not…no, it is not the tutorial. Tutorial is the little boxes. Bubbles that show you what’s what. It …Tutorial shows you what those fields are. What //field contains what. 

Will: //Okay. I am just…Okay. Hold on. Message me…send to…

Vika: What?

Will: Inbox one. Please [UI] //from system inbox…

Ashley: //[UI]

Vika: Is everything working?

00:08:30:03

Igor: Here’s a message. Has it arrived?

Katya: Now I…

Igor: On the left you will see who the message is from. On the left-hand side under the word “Inbox” it says who the messages came from. On the right, it says whom to send them to and where the messages have already been. 

Salah: So, if I have the message, I

00:09:00:50

Salah:  just look at it or…

Igor: You don’t have to read the messages. 

Salah: Okay. 

Will: Can we turn on some cool music?

Igor: Only if it’s cool. 

Will: Only if it’s not The Animals. 

Igor: And only if there is consensus. If everybody wants it. Because…

Vika: And why… it is repeating itself, isn’t it? We need to skip it…

Igor: It may circle. Depending on the task, depending on who you picked

Vika: Okay. 

Igor: Depending on

00:09:30:10

Igor: what everybody is doing. Maybe, start and look.

Vika: Do I understand correctly? This is…

Igor: This is from…a message from the drilling specialist. 

Vika: Okay. …//And how do I understand to whom…I don’t understand.

Will: //[UI]

Katya: I can only forward it to two people, right? And that’s it?

00:09:59:25

Igor: Only to one of your two contacts. Yes.

Oleg: //[SL] Okay, alright. 

Vika: Now I click on it and…how do I know whom to forward it to. 

Oleg: You need to see about the overall workload and how many incoming messages they already have. That’s what I think.

Will: If there are already ten //we need to forward more so that it’s even more fun. 

Igor: //Never mind. [UI]

Vika: [SL] Structure system

Salah: Here, they are looking.

Will: I…

00:10:30:12

Salah: Okay. //[SL] Bunch of messages they have. 

Ashley: //This is interesting. 

Salah: Ten now! // Eleven. 

Vika: //I don’t understand.

Will: You’ve got to start…//sending them.

Ashley: //You’ve got to start answering them. Forcing them forward. 

Salah: They said, “don’t look at the message”.

Will: //No, no, no.

Igor: //No, no, no. 

Ashley: You have to look at them.

Will: You have to choose…
Igor: That’s right, yes. You have to…

Will: No, don’t.

Igor: It tells you who the messages…

Salah: Igor, now I have eleven inbox. 

Will: //Like, “I’m not doing anything”.

Ashley: //Oh my god! You’ve got to start sending them to one of your //two contacts now basically. 

Igor: //Sorry, yes. You’re doing it…//there is a description of the role 

Will: //Choose one. 

Ashley: There is a description, so

Will: Choose one. 

00:10:59:08

Ashley: //it’ll say, like…

Will: //Description. Choose one.

Igor: //Here, there is a description of the person whom you need to send it to. 

Salah: //I choose one.

Ashley: //But, based on what it says, though. 

Vika: Oh.

Ashley: //Like, if it says, like, you know…

Will: //So, read…read this. This is the message. That’s the message. Read this. This is the where //it needs to go. That’s the message, that’s…You don’t need to read that. You need to read that. 
And you can choose one of those. 

Katya: //Question. As I understand it, I send it here, right? The one the geologist sent to me…

Igor: But it won’t necessarily be one of these two people. In the end, this message…

Katya: So, I need to be on his team, right?

Igor: Okay, so. I apologize. I probably misspoke and I oversimplified the things a little bit. You need to know who is doing what in general. You don’t need to know the details. You know.

Salah: Yeah.

Igor: Not very [UI] but…

00:11:32:24

Will: Cool. 

Ashley: Yeah. I routed a lot of stuff to you too. 

Will: Oh, wow!

Ashley: To Abdullah. [UI]

Will: Oh, damn it! 

Igor: In the header, it says whom to send it to.

Will: I clicked on it randomly. Okay, it’s alright.

Oleg: Okay, next. 

Vika: So, if I am at least included in this group, 

00:11:59:26

Vika: he will then be able to forward it to his…

Igor: We don’t know. It’s the same way as you perhaps not communicating within your group. //We don’t know who picked whom. Anybody could…Anybody could’ve picked anybody. It’s not limited to your specialty group. 

Ashley: //Oops, I just picked…

Will: //Oopie. Yeah. 

Ashley: I literally just got the message…Wait, what?

Igor: We’re picking two contacts and then that team //can pick any other people outside. 

Katya: //Okay. Question.

Ashley: //Oh, yeah. Any two people. Yeah, yeah. 

Katya: Question. And how…So I understand whom to send it to. Where do I…

Igor: No. You can send //only to one of the two people that you think…click on them. Click on them, yes. That’s it. You have forwarded it to him.

Ashley: //I just did the dumbest thing. I just got the message from the maintenance specialist, and I sent it back.

00:12:31:11

Katya: Okay, I’ve forwarded it. 

Will: Oopie. 

Ashley: I did not mean to do that. 

00:12:38:17 – 00:13:16:19

[no audio]

Vika: Oh, I see now. So what…

00:13:21:00 – 00:14:00:10

[no audio]

Vika: Igor, and this thing here – their workload, right?

Igor: Yes. 

Vika: Just horrible.

Oleg: //[UI]

Will: //I’m just fucking pounding the operations specialist. 

Oleg: I have one message circling around.

Igor: Well, that means... Perhaps, you should draw some conclusions.

Ashley: I see the hydrogeologist// is sending stuff my way. 

Katya: //[UI]

Oleg: And how do I understand that it is…so, it’s from the message itself that I understand that it is mine. 

Igor: We don’t open the message itself in the app. It says who it’s for. It’s in the description, 

00:14:30:17

Igor: //the person to whom…

Katya: //It went to from you and who it came from to you.

Oleg: Yes. It came back.

Katya: You sent it twice to the same //person, it seems.

Will: //Cool. 

Oleg: No. Different. Different. 

Igor: //No. If it’s sent to you. If it came to you, that’s it. It’s delivered. It will not be circulating further.

Katya: //Oh, yes. That’s right.

Will: //Too bad. 

Katya: Yeah.

Igor: So, if a message was sent to you and it made it to you, it’s taken out of circulation, basically.

Will: Cool. 

Vika: Okay. [UI]

Will: Destination – me?

00:14:59:15

Will: “You are the final destination for these messages.”

Vika: Okay. And here we can…that’s delivery, right? [UI]. Oh, that’s very interesting. 

Igor: Yes, you can see in the history that it was delivered quickly.  

Ashley: Well, this one is just going back and forth. 

Will: I love it. 

Vika: Oh. Wow!

Will: So, send it to somebody else. 

Salah: But…

Ashley:  No, I mean, like, I’ve sent it to both people at this point. 

Will: Oh, man!

Salah: //[UI]

Ashley: Now it’s come back to me full circle. 

Igor: This is you

Ashley: Fuck! //Okay.

Vika: //Well. 

00:15:30:05

Ashley: I think we are all…

Vika: Oh! Oh! There we go. There, get it. Great. Cool. 

00:15:39:04 – 00:16:00:21

[no audio] 

Oleg: Can’t get through it all. 

00:16:05:09 – 00:16:41:25
 
[no audio]

Will: Vika, you are the hydrologist…hydrogeologist, yes?

Vika: Yes.

Will: Hydrogeologist. 

Vika: Yes, yes.

Will: Okay.

Vika: How do I increase the brightness on my computer?

Will: [UI]

Vika: It’s gotten pretty dark. 

Igor: Here?

Vika: Oh, that’s right. 

Will: Shoot.

Salah: Where is, like…this is…It’s to me. Where should I put it? Or [SL] Nord.

Will: Just choose someone, like…throw it someone’s way. Just throw it to somebody. 

Igor: Twenty-five seconds.

Vika: Okay. 

Will: Throw all your messages. Go!

00:17:15:09

Will: Shoot! In any direction! 

Oleg: Do they even respond there?

Igor: They all participate, but again you can see who does what there.

Oleg: So here I can see those addressed to me?

Igor: Destination – you.

Oleg: Well.

Igor: That’s it. Session is over. 

Will: Cool. 

Katya: [UI]

Igor: Okay. So…

00:17:45:15

Igor: You might’ve learned something. Maybe you didn’t. Maybe, you understood something…

Oleg: Well, overall, there’s this idea that…Oh. Again. Or we are supposed to agree in advance who communicates with whom and we all interact…in advance. 

Will: I think…

Vika: But why?

Oleg: But the thing is that, see, I already have messages that have circled around. 

00:18:15:17

Oleg: So, one person has already picked me, and I picked them. //And this person…

Vika: //But you can pick some other person. 

Oleg: What?

Vika: You simply choose a different person. 

Will: Yes.

Oleg: No. 

Katya: Maybe, we should establish a system based on our roles? For example, choose so that I have two…I choose such that the specialist is bipolar, 

Igor: I…

Katya: at least. 

Igor: I wanted to tell you that you can now sit here, because at first I kept my computer here. One person can now sit here. You are sitting so close together. You can now find different spots for sitting. 

Oleg: Really?

Igor: You can now. 

00:18:44:21

Vika: I would like to sit on the floor. 

Will: Well…yes, yes. Okay.

Igor: You can change where you are sitting now. 

Will: Okay. I will go sit in a different place.

Igor: Well, no. We can just spread out a bit. 

Will: Okay. 

Katya: Is that necessary?

Igor: No, no. You don’t have to. //You just can.

Katya: I can stay in my place.

Igor: No. Two people on one side and two people on the other so that…

Vika: A, okay.

Igor: So we are not too close together. 

Will: Thank you…Now we can…

Vika: [UI]

00:19:15:06

Ashley: Oh. //Oh, sorry!

Igor: //I am doing a technique now. Right now. I will call you back [UI]

Vika: //[UI]

Ashley: //It’s a little warm.

Vika: Wheelchair. 

Igor: Twenty something. 

Vika: [UI]

Igor: Yeah, so, you [SL] come forward. 

Oleg: Well, are there any other suggestions?

Igor: We can talk.

Will: [UI]

Oleg: I got the impression that I accidentally chose somebody that had chosen me. But it’s somebody that is not here. It is probably from somewhere in Chicago…//, and we practically to each other…

Igor: //I will say right away. We are pretty limited in terms of time today.

00:19:46:16

Igor: Well, because we have people waiting there. So, you can talk about this quickly, but then we should start. You can then do something next time. Okay?

Oleg: Yes.

Igor: It’s just that the time is not //limitless.

Vika: Are we choosing or are we agreeing?

Oleg: Yes. We are choosing. 

Ashley: Choosing.

Vika: Okay. 

Katya: We can’t decide and agree, right?

Igor: Well, you can. You can but…

Katya: Perhaps, we should broaden it so that…

Will: Can we now?

Igor: Yes.

Will: Great. Cool!

Oleg: That’s it. Next.

00:20:16:12

Igor: [UI]

Katya: [UI]

Oleg: So…

Katya: Okay. 

Ashley: Oops. 

Will: Remember, if something is not clear, just send it on to somebody.

Vika: What?

Will: If you don’t know, just give it to somebody.

Vika: Yes. 

Will: There is no need to sit on them. It’s not like that will help.

Salah: [SL] Sorry. 

Ashley: Yeah.

 Will: Cool. 

Oleg: Okay…Katyusha, where are you going?

Katya: Just a sec, just a sec. 

00:20:47:10

Will: This is the time to actually do something cool. 

Oleg: The thing here is to give it to someone that can receive and process it as quickly as possible. But not to the person that sent it to you. 

Vika: Well, not necessarily. Maybe, you will send it back. Of course, you will exchange messages for a while, but then the one that sent it to you will send it on to somebody else. 

Oleg: But if that person sent it to you, it means that he or she looked and nothing…

Will: But, maybe, that person did it quickly. Perhaps, they did not think about it. 

00:21:15:18

Will: Perhaps, he or she //thought it was for you, but maybe another person on their team can send it to someone else. We don’t know. Just think about it and give it to someone. The quicker the better.

Vika: //Yes, yes…I agree. 

Oleg: //Okay, so…

Oleg: Well, //I have two crew members that were

Ashley: //[SL] Everyone was here. Yes?

Will: Okay. Let’s roll. “Skip this tutorial.” Okay. 

Oleg: Oh, so…

00:21:45:21

Will: Good evening.

00:21:47:22 – 00:22:03:25

[no audio]

Oleg: Where? Last time, it was all very dynamic. I don’t write so many messages in one day.

Katya: Oleg, it’s just that this time we are not the popular ones

Oleg: Yes. I chose somebody wrong, so that I…

Katya: //Wow! I have an assignment…

Salah: //So, I know now who was messaging me before. 

Ashley: //I was pushing a lot last time, too. 

Oleg: //Oh, here you are!

Salah: [SL]Now you’re pushing it too. 

Katya: Yeah?

Oleg: Next, next, next, next. 

00:22:30:05

Oleg: This is again just instructions. Complete the assignments too. Okay. Next. …And…I have a feeling that they are playing their own game there in Chicago. 

Vika: I want to play in your sandbox.

Oleg: Yes. So now what? Oh! 

00:23:04:08

Oleg: Where?!

Ashley: Still nothing?

Oleg: Let’s not write! Ourselves then? …Oh, we have happier people here.

Will: Cool, cool, cool. Cool, cool, cool. 

Vika: Hm. Rather [UI]

00:23:30:12

Oleg: Wow. 

Katya: What an amazing letter.

Oleg: Oh, please this one goes there. [UI]

Ashley: [UI]

Oleg: [UI] with speed…So…

Salah: Hm…Now I got it! …So, Igor! If this message contained me, 

00:24:00:17

Salah: I have to make it like this, right? Destination – me. Right?

Ashley: You mean the final message. I think you’re fine. It would just…

Igor: No. Those would be the messages that you receive. 

Salah: Yeah, but this is the…this is me. This is my job. Yeah, where should I keep it?

Igor: No, it should. 

Salah: Okay, will…

Igor: Is that you?

Salah: Yeah. That’s my job. 

Ashley: You’re maintenance costs? Upkeeping maintenance?

Salah: Maintenance and robots. Cost of robots and rovers.

Ashley: I thought you were materials specialist. 

Igor: Were you…

00:24:30:25

Salah: Yeah, this is me. 	

Ashley: Okay. Because I would think that that would fall more under maintenance specialist and not materials specialist. 

Salah: No, it is one of my main things.

Ashley: One of, but maybe you’re not the best person to be final.

Igor: You are materials specialist, right?

Salah: Yeah. 

Katya: But we’re in one group with Abdulla. 

Salah: Yeah, yeah.

Katya: It’s our job to use the cheapest robotics. 

00:25:00:28

Igor: These should be your individual goals. Not your team goals. 

Oleg: No. Something is not right here. 

Katya: [UI]

Oleg: We had the last one, it’s just…

Ashley: Perhaps, they say something there. 

Oleg: //very many letters. Now there are none. 

Igor: //[UI]

Salah: Okay.

Oleg: Are we sure everything is working right?

Will: //We have everything working right.

Salah: //[UI]

Oleg: Time is slipping away. 

Ashley: This one has gone through a lot of people.

Oleg: I have a feeling that they are sending messages to each other there.

Will: Well, we…

00:25:29:18

Will: I have many, //those that already…

Oleg: Oh, okay. //[UI]

Salah: //[UI]

Igor: You can minimize overall the rover’s cost. Here…

Salah: [UI]

Igor: But there is no maintenance.

Will: Damn. 

Oleg: Oops! 

Salah: Okay, [UI]

Igor: This is labor. Some others need their stuff. Cost of drilling a hole. 

Salah: Okay. 

Oleg: [UI]

00:26:00:20

Vika: We still can’t find it, right?

Oleg: Oh, it’s working. [UI] Hydrogeologist…please. [UI]

Salah: [SL] We’re just sitting like this. 

Ashley: Looks like four made it to their final destination. 

Vika: Oh! It is for you. It’s for you, Abdulla. Okay. 

00:26:30:11

Oleg: Catch. 

Vika: Yes. 

Will: Cool, cool, cool. Wow, I have done, //so many things.

Oleg: //And this thing here “complete” – it means it has been delivered to the addressee, correct?

Vika: Yes. And these…

Oleg: This here. Where you see “sent” – that is everything. 

Salah: Yes. 

00:27:00:00

Salah: To maintenance?

Maybe Ashley: Yeah, yeah. 

Igor: They show up there.

Vika: Oh, cool. 

Ashley: Yeah, yeah. Like, they come up…

Igor: Yes. 

Will: Oh, cool. //You see. I did it even better. Look here – sent…

Igor: //You get a message and then go there and now [UI]. So, [UI] got it. But that’s okay. 

Vika: And here’s what I have. Here. 

Will: Not as many as me. 

Vika: And what do I have? Is it okay if I don’t //join the cool guys’ club?

Will: I am super. I am one super office worker. 

Vika: What?

00:27:30:19

Katya: Well done. 

Oleg: Here’s one. 

Vika: Well done, okay. 

Oleg: There, please [UI]

Vika: [SL] Turn it on. 

Oleg: [UI] Construction cost. Construction [UI]. 

00:27:46:14 – 00:28:00:09

[no audio]

Will: Damn!

Oleg: [SL] Aggression again. 

Vika: It did not get there in the end.

Will: It was the last one…

Katya: I hope somebody chose [UI] because this message…

Will: Get that!

Vika: Yes, me too…

Will: Get it! 

Oleg: So, the rover [UI]

00:28:40:05

Vika: Oh, yeah. 

Maybe Ashley: [SL] What is it?

Vika: I’ll refresh. 

Oleg: Just look in the history who sent it to whom. What “complete” stops at. Who is connected with whom. 

Katya: But here in the end…

Vika: Yes, of course, we can look in the history.

Oleg: Yes. You look in the history, and you can see who is forwarding it to whom. 


00:29:10:02

Oleg: And the branches…here – it’s not for no reason that they are there. And even the whole network many have been deciphered already. 

Katya: Here, we have a message that got stuck with the Martian Terrain specialist…We have it here.

Oleg: In general, we could have sent them to all twelve and among them see which one can…More precisely, not who can send to whom, but who has already sent it to whom. And then the whole scheme will be known. 

00:29:39:18

Oleg: So, this is [UI]. [UI]

00:29:48:21 – 00:30:15:20

[no audio]

Oleg: What’s good is that either because of the number of messages…I have all the messages delivered. …or they simply can’t get out of some never-ending loop there. Abdulla, I see you are also bored.

Salah: I…

Oleg: See what you have there in sent? Are there many in there?

Vika: Uh-oh. Uh-oh. 

Salah: No. 

Will: What did you do?

Oleg: Everything complete? Complete, complete, complete. 

00:30:45:13

Salah: Yes. 

Oleg: Oh, there aren’t that many of them. … Why aren’t they writing letters to you?

Salah: I…they are still looking. 

Oleg: You are not…

Katya: I am trying to choose so as not to repeat it.

Oleg: Well, what you have can’t be repeated anyway. Give it to anyone. This one is reading now, and you give it to that other one. Let him figure out whom to send it to. 

00:31:14:26

Oleg: Oh, there. It is, then [UI]

Oleg: I have a feeling that everyone has now selected somebody wrong.

Katya: Yes.

Oleg: And…//went from…

Will: //Shoot, I have so many…I mean, I’ve done it. I’ve been able to do so much. 

00:31:45:17

Ashley: Popular. 

Will: I didn’t get a lot of messages, but they are just, like…Everyone sends me the ones for her. And, so, I was, like, “Alright. Okay, cool”. 

Salah: Yeah.

Vika: You know why you have so many…you have so many completed? Because you sent all the letters to me. 

Will: Of course. 

Salah: Okay.

Will: We are on the geologist team, right? I guess the people there know…//they will forward things to us [UI]

Igor:// Okay. So, now 

00:32:15:27

Igor: you have one survey to complete after this.

Ashley: Okay.

Igor: You can minimize this.

Vika: Alright.

Will: Not the camera.

Igor: Yeah, keep the camera rolling. Going to your Crew Data folder. Survey links.

Oleg: Okay, //are we turning off the camera?

Katya: [UI]

Igor: No. 

Oleg: No?

Katya: I’ve stopped it. 

Igor: Start it again. 

Will: Which one?

Oleg: So, survey?

Igor: Survey links.

Salah: Crew Mission?

Igor: Yeah. DeChurch. Yeah. 

Will: And we are not turning it on, are we?

Igor: No, it is recording everything. 

00:32:45:25

Will: Good. 

Igor: So far. 

Vika: DeChurch…

Igor: DeChurch 2C.

Will: [UI]

Igor: Number ten. 

Vika: Okay. 

Igor: DeChurch Ten. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: DeChurch. DeChurch. 

Igor: It may be a little tricky, //but you are learning today. Next time you will know what they’re asking. 

Oleg: //Ten? Ten, yes?

Ashley: 2C.

Igor: DeChurch ten, which is 2C post Multiteam task Relay. 

00:33:20:00

Igor: No! Stop! Five-digit NASA code. 

Oleg: Oh. 

Salah: Sirius ID.

Oleg: No, no, no, no.

Igor: Five digit. Whenever you are doing HRP, five-digit NASA code. 

00:33:30:11 – 00:33:45:18

[no audio]

Igor: Were you able to do it in English?

Vika: In Russian. 

Igor: In Russian. Okay. 

00:33:52:16 – 00:37:30:28

[no audio]

Salah: Just to make sure…I’m on the right path. 

00:37:48:13 – 00:40:02:24

[no audio]

Oleg: You should have recorded everything. 

Vika: There will be other opportunities.

Katya: Can I ask a question?

Igor: Yes.

Katya: But it will be a prompt, essentially. Can I ask such a question?

Igor: You can ask. I may not answer.

Katya: What is maintenance specialist in Russian? What is the Russian word for it?

Igor: Maintenance – it’s servicing. 

Katya: Okay, thank you.

Igor: Is there such a thing – servicing specialist?

Oleg: Yes. For operations. For servicing?

Igor: For servicing. 

00:40:30:24

Oleg: There is such a thing for maintenance services. For technical services.

Igor: Mhm. 

Oleg: [UI]

Katya: Mhm. Thank you. 

Igor: I thought that all the roles in the task are in English. Now, I see them in Russian here. After the tenth time, you will figure it out.

Oleg: Yes, here…

00:41:05:26

Oleg: It was not for no reason that a list was mentioned. We should have looked in the messages. 

Igor: Yes, well, for today, it’s a kind of an introduction. You will know because I think that you will approach these in a different way…

Oleg: //Yes, this one is just introductory.

Oleg: The thing is, in this situation, what was contained in the messages is the direct response to this one. To be honest, I saw where they communicated among themselves and

00:41:30:06

Oleg: this explanation of who interacts with whom – give us this please…

Igor: That would speed up the process here

Oleg: What?

Igor: That would speed up the process and the responses would be more precise.

Oleg: Yes, yes, yes. They would be more precise. 

Igor: Well, we are following the sequence that the researchers asked us to follow.

Oleg: Yes. //In this situation 

Igor: //[UI]

Oleg: It’s already going…

Igor: This is an introductory session.

Oleg: Yes. 

Igor: That’s what it’s for. 

00:42:01:23

Oleg: It’s just that, according to the rules of this game, it…

Igor: About the table. You will have the same table in the barrel. Therefore,…

Will: //Well, we’ve already sat there, really…

Igor: It’s about the same format.

Will: In terms of the size, it is a little bit…It is longer, for some reason. 

Igor: Well, I mean that we got back to the question of bringing one more table. We can do it today, but there you will still have less space. 

Will: Yes, when we were sitting there, it was somehow

00:42:31:08

Will: just, for some reason…

Oleg: It’s square. It’s just that it is square.

Will: It’s more square. 

Katya: And you can also put it there next to it. Get to it from the side…

Will: Oh, yes, yes. 

Salah: Okay. Done?

Igor: If you are done, you can stop the recording, stop the video, close the browser…and transfer the audio. Yeah. 

Will: Okay, so. Stop here?

Igor: Yeah, if you are finished with the survey, you can stop the video. Stop the audio.
