Translation


Ashley: [UI]

Oleg: [SL] Damn. It’s on.  

Salah: I saw it, Will.

Ashley: Okay. 

Vika: Hmm.

Ashley: Everyone ready?

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: Okay. 

Will: I won’t be looking for points today. 

Vika: Is it a threat?

Ashley: Ready?
00:00:28:18

Ashley: Today is April 19th, 2022. It’s mission day 166, and the time is 2:25PM. Three, two, one. //Mark.

All: //Mark! 

Will: Alright. It’s okay. What? Everyone knows.  

Salah: Who is Mark?

Vika: Mark Semyonovich. 

Will: Alright. If you have an idea, you got to tell it to me because I’m not gonna search for my own points. 

00:01:00:10

Will: I’m just gonna vet people’s points. 

Ashley: Oh, shoot. I’m having issues with my interface. 

Will: Oh, well. Too bad for you. 

Vika: Oh. 

Ashley: You too?

Vika: [UI]. I think so. Yeah.

Will:  I guess we won’t check any points then. 

Ashley: Oh, shoot.

Oleg: Damn. 

Ashley: Me too.  

Oleg: Is it not showing up for you either?

Salah: It’s working for me. Thirteen forty-three.

Will: Thirteen forty-three.



00:01:31:00

Ashley: Okay. I’ll close it and start…

Vika: Again?

Will: No water. 

Salah: Okay. 

Oleg: Same for me. 

Salah: No problem. I’ll give the other point. 

Ashley: Damn!

Vika: How did you get it?

Salah: Thirty-one thirty-one. 

Ashley: I’m just //restarting my browser really fast. 

Salah: //I’ll give you all my points now. 

Will: //I know. One second. Let me send a comms check. 

Vika: Oh, maybe mine is working. 

00:02:00:10

Vika: Let me ask. 

Will: Which one?

Salah: Thirty-one thirty-one.

Vika: Now it’s all [UI]. 

Will: Not bad. It’s got high water loss, but it’s got enough to where it’s decent. So, that one could function. 

Vika: Did you get my letter?

Will: Yes. 

Vika: Check it out.  

Will: Hold on, hold on. 

Oleg: Mine doesn’t show either. 

Ashley: Mine isn’t working today.

Vika: [SL] How do you know that?

Salah: What about you, Vika?

00:02:30:09

Vika: Just a sec. Oh, okay. 

Salah: It’s working?

Vika: //Yes!

Oleg: //Restarting it didn’t help. 

Vika: Yeah.

Ashley: [UI]

Salah: Thirty-one thirty-one.

Ashley: Oh, now it’s working.  

Will: Oh. 

Vika: Oh.

Oleg: Yeah. I don’t get it.  

Ashley: So…

Vika: Umm, actually, it’s too dirty. 

Ashley: Do you want us to check any points or…

Vika: Thirty-one thirty-one.

Ashley: Thirty-one thirty-one.

Will: Thirty-one thirty-one. Yeah. 

Vika: For me it’s high level of contamination. 

00:03:00:26

Ashley: Thirty-one thirty-one. Not bad for me.  

00:03:08:01 – 00:03:48:19

[no audio]

Oleg: Twenty-five twenty-six.  

Will: Twenty-five //twenty-six. 

Oleg: //twenty-six. 

Vika: Drumroll… 

Will: Very little water.  

Oleg: Mhm. 

00:04:06:18 – 00:04:16:28

[no audio]

Ashley: May I have my book?

Oleg: You don’t remember?

Vika: So, twenty-five twenty-six – the water is very dirty. Seventy-eight. 

Will: Yeah, //and there is not enough water.

Vika: //Too much. 

Oleg: There…It’s the big…stones. It’s clean…

Vika: What if they are small? Thirty-one thirty-one has exactly the same percentage, but with small ones.  

Oleg: Thirty-one thirty-one?

Vika: Mhm.
 
Oleg: Hold on. 

00:04:54:25

Ashley: Ooh. Ooh.

Oleg: Well, this is a different story. 

Ashley: How about thirty-eight twelve?

Will: Thirty-eight twelve?

Ashley: Mhm.

Will: Thirty-eight twelve?

Ashley: Mhm. 

Will: No water. 

Vika: [PH] Boring! 

Salah: It’s deep also. 

Will: Should I send thirty-one thirty-one? Is it possible?

Salah: I sent it already. I’m asking. 

Will: Okay. 

Salah: But you can ask your team also. 

Ashley: Yeah. I mean, it’s like mediocre for me. 

00:05:30:09

Ashley: But it’s fine. It works for most.

00:05:31:21 – 00:06:32:24

[no audio]

Oleg: What do you think about four eighteen?

Will: Four eighteen. Hold on. Wait.  Yeah. No water. 

Ashley: Very bad for me. 

Oleg: There is a plain there. …Damn. As soon as I find clean water, turns out there is no water at all. 

00:07:02:17

Vika: That’s why it’s so clean.  

Will: It’s like I have a clean person but there is no person.

Salah: Check thirty-five six. 

Will: Thirty-five six. Not bad. You are on a roll today. 

Vika: //Thirty-five six.

Salah: //What about you, guys?

Vika: Just a sec. 

Ashley: I like thirty-five six. 

00:07:31:19

Salah: Oleg?

Oleg: Hold on. [SL] thirty-five? Thirty-five six. 

Vika: Kind of dirty. 

Will: It’s pretty much the same amount of water as in thirty-one thirty-one. So, the dirtier one //[UI]

Oleg: //This one will be really hard to clean.

Ashley: //Thirty-five six was better.

Vika: //These are two different things because thirty-one thirty-one has only one indicator,

00:08:00:05

Vika: While here we have three indicators higher than fifty. 

Will: We only have two points with water present. It’s thirty-one thirty-one and thirty-five six.  

Ashley: I would…I would pick thirty-five six between these two.  

Will: Okay. 

Vika: //Oleg, will you be able to clean it?

Ashley: //Much better for me.

Oleg: //Hold on.

Salah: Sometimes it’s good for us but it’s not good for them.

Ashley: I know. 

Salah: So…

Vika: Thank you. 

Oleg: Damn. There is 60% loss.  

00:08:30:21

Will: Hm.

Oleg: Three high indicators.

Will: Let’s move on. Keep looking. …How much did you eat?

Vika: Fatty! 

Will: That’s right. 



00:08:50:15 – 00:09:13:16

[no audio]

Ashley: What about forty thirteen. Forty thirteen.

Will: Forty thirteen. Hm. Not a lot of water but it does have a usable amount. 

Ashley: Hm. What does everyone else think, too?

Salah: It’s deep.

Ashley: Too deep?

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: Hm. 

Oleg: Yes. 

Vika: Wait, one more time. One more time please. 

Ashley: Forty thirteen. 

00:09:45:03

Oleg: The water is murky. 

Ashley: Hm.

Oleg: Dirty.

Salah: The depth is double the depth of thirty-five six. 

Ashley: Hm. 

Will: And it’s half the water of thirty-five six. 

Ashley: Okay. So, we will ex-nay that. 

Vika: High level of// contamination.

Will: //[UI]. Yeah. 

00:10:02:22 – 00:10:33:04

[no audio]

Will: Don’t you see how much you’ve eaten?

Salah: Check twenty-nine sixteen. 

Will: Which one?

Salah: Twenty-nine sixteen. 

Will: No water. 

Salah: Hm.

00:11:05:28

Will: Oh. 

Vika: Well.

Oleg: Thirty forty. 

Will: Yes…possible, possible.

Vika: I like it. 

Oleg: I think it’s good for Salah too because it’s not too deep. 

00:11:31:06

Salah: Forty…

Oleg: Thirty forty.

Salah: Okay. 

00:11:33:07 – 00:11:49:00

[no audio]

Will: How do you like it?

Vika: I like it. Thirty forty is good. 

Salah: Very good. 

Will: Okay. Let me send that one. 

Oleg: Minimal loss for me.

Ashley: You said thirty forty //is the good one?

Will: //Yeah. It’s not a lot of water but it’s functional and it’s clean. So, you’re getting…

Salah: So, between the three: thirty-one thirty-one and thirty-five, I think, six…

Ashley: So, thirty-one, thirty-one, thirty-five thirty-six…Sorry, thirty-five six. 

00:12:20:20

Salah: Thirty-five six and…

Ashley: And thirty forty. 

Vika: Six…

Salah: And thirty forty. About the water?

Will: I mean…which one? Thirty forty?

Vika: Yes. 

Salah: Thirty-forty, yeah. 

Ashley: That was the last one that he suggested. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: That one, you said, was decent, right?

Vika: Thirty forty – the last one.

Will: Yeah, yeah. It has…it’s not a lot of water but if it’s clean water then it’s less of a big deal. 

Vika: Sixteen twelve. 

00:12:51:00

Vika: Check sixteen twelve please. 

Ashley: Not great for me. 

Salah: //It’s deep. 

Vika: //[UI]

Will: Sixteen twelve?

Ashley: Yeah. 

Vika: Yes.

Salah: Deep. 

Vika: Already…already pass on that. 

Will: Not bad. 

Ashley: Oh. //Well, now the water guy likes it.

Vika: //What are you gonna say now?! Hm?

Ashley: How about thirty e…

Will: It’s not great, //but it’s…

Vika: //Do you need sugar?

Oleg: Which one? Thirty…

Ashley: She said…sixteen twelve, right?

00:13:21:18

Vika: Yes.

Ashley: And I’d like to suggest…

Vika: I already deleted that one. 

Ashley: Thirty-eight eighteen. 

Vika: Thirty-eight eighteen?

Will: //Thirty-eight eighteen. 

Ashley: //Check it out.

00:13:49:04

Will: It’s the least //amount of water. 

Vika: What? [UI]

Will: It functions but it’s still the least amount of water. 

Ashley: Alright, alright. So…

Vika: It’s okay for me. 

Ashley: Which ones do you…

Salah: Which one, you think, is the best one between all the points?

Will: Let me see here. From my point of view…

Salah: Mhm. 

Will: One second. 

00:14:22:00

Will: From what I can tell, thirty-forty is probably the cleanest. It’s the lower end of the acceptable range of water, but it’s clean. So…

Vika: What about…

Ashley: So, that would be your number one choice?

Oleg: Twenty-one thirty-five. 

Will: I guess. 

Ashley: Twenty-one thirty-five.

Oleg: I get that. Salah will say that it’s //too…

Salah: //Thirty…

00:14:50:24

Will: Not bad actually. 

Oleg: What’s wrong?

Salah: It’s mediocre. 

Vika: It’s okay for me. 

Salah: Mediocre. 

Oleg: What’s up? What?

Ashley: The worst for me. 

Oleg: What’s the worst for you?

Salah: But thirty forty is much better for me. 

Ashley: Location accessibility – low; population – low

Vika: Ew.

Will: Actually, this last one has the highest…

00:15:19:25

Oleg: Amount?

Will: Amount up until now. How is it? Is it dirty?

Vika: It’s okay. 

Oleg: Which one? Which one?

Will: Twenty-one thirty-five. I would…for me - for my purposes twenty-one thirty-five is the best. 

Vika: //Well, it’s cleaner than…

Oleg: //Well, minimal losses for me. 

Will: Yeah. So, like…

Vika: than…

Salah: Which one? Which one?

Will: Twenty-one thirty-five is the best in terms of amount of water we can get. 

Vika: It’s cleaner than thirty forty...

Salah: But it’s not good for Ash. For me it’s normal. 

00:15:49:16

Salah: It’s not good //it’s in the middle. 

Vika: //looking at the numbers…

Ashley: I mean, it’s like…it’s like mediocre. Doesn’t reach a high population.

Vika: But thirty-forty has more water. 

Ashley: Did you suggest all four of those points to your people?

Will: I’ve suggested three: thirty-one thirty-one, thirty forty and twenty-one thirty-five. 

Ashley: You didn’t suggest thirty-five six?

Salah: Thirty-five six?

00:16:20:00

Ashley: That one was pretty good for us too. 

Will: I can. I feel like they said that it was dirty.

Oleg: Can you check one more? Forty-five twenty-six. 

Salah: They are not replying. 

Ashley: One more time, please. 

Oleg: Forty-five twenty-six. 

Vika: Well, alright. 

Ashley: Where is it?

Vika: The water loss //is too high. 

Ashley: //[SL] on my picture.

Salah: Forty…forty-five?

00:16:50:25

Oleg: Forty-five

Salah: Yeah. 

Oleg: Twenty-six. 

Ashley: I like it. 

Vika: Will you be able to clean it?

Will: //Which one?

Oleg: //Yes. 

Vika: Forty-five twenty-six. 

Oleg: Finally, you like something. 

Will: There is some water. 

Salah: Okay. 

Will: But not that much. 

00:17:21:09

Salah: Do you have pistachio? [SL] Sorry.

Ashley: You said “pistachiO” 

Salah: Huh?

Ashley: You said “pistachiO”. One. So, that’s all she gives you. 

Vika: Everything for you, tiger. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: //Why aren’t they replying? Oh, hold on fluid engineer. 

Vika: //[UI]

Salah: //[SL] Number, number. 

Vika: [SL] Number. Yes. 

Ashley: [SL] Number, number. Number. 

00:17:55:11

Vika: Hm. One point seven. 

Ashley: One seven?

Vika: Yes. 

Ashley: Eh. 

Vika: Please give me two.

Ashley: Eh. 

Will: Did you not eat yours?

Vika: No. [UI]. Do you want?

Salah: Normal. 

Ashley: One seven is not great. 

Will: No, no, no.

Salah: Normal.

00:18:30:03

Will: No. What are you doing? What are you doing? I gave you two. I asked you if you ate it already. Looks like you did.

Vika: No. 

Ashley: Would be low-cost but reaches low people. 

Salah: Did you get any reply from them?

Will: //Yeah, finally. 

Ashley: //I got one. Fluid engineer responded in the engineering team chat. Ope, I think my…Oh, Martian terrain specialist: “We are looking at thirty-one thirty-one now”.

00:19:09:16

Vika: No! Well, at least…

Ashley: [singing] We live in isolation. We have everything. 

Vika: [singing] And we did not lose our minds at all. None of us.

00:19:30:14

Ashley: [singing] Every day we think about getting out. 

Vika: Did you write down for Clement…for Clement One about suicide? Okay.

00:19:58:21

Will: What?

Ashley: The mechanical engineer is not online by the way. 

Vika: What? Only one hundred. 

Salah: How do you know?

Ashley: Drilling specialist just said. 

Salah: Okay. 

Ashley: They are also looking at forty-five forty-seven. They are looking at forty-five forty-seven. //So, maybe we also…

Vika: //Could you check, please forty…forty-eight forty-five. 

Ashley: But first, can you…

Vika: I can. I can.

Will: Forty-five forty-seven. 

Ashley: Yes. 

Will: Not bad! That’s the best one ever! 

Ashley: Forty-five// forty-seven.

Will: //That is a huge amount of water. 

00:20:31:05

Will: That is a geyser!

Vika: And forty-eight //forty-five?

Ashley: //That’s not bad! Forty-five? Forty-eight forty-five?

Vika: Forty-eight forty-five. 

Oleg: Yeah, okay. 

Ashley: //Forty-five forty-seven?

Salah: //Forty-five seven?

Will: Forty-five forty-seven. 

Oleg: Yeah, but…

Salah: Forty-seven?

Will: Forty-five forty-seven. 

Ashley: //Yeah, that’s what they suggested. 

Vika: //Forty-five forty-seven is really dirty. 

Oleg: Well, only one indicator. It can be…

Will: Forty-five forty-seven? There is a lot of fucking water. 

Oleg: Yes.

Vika: But it’s very dirty. 

Salah: //Yeah.

Will: //Well…

00:20:59:27

Vika: Like, //three indicators show over 50%.

Ashley: //Is it really deep there?

Salah: //It’s really good. 

Ashley: I really like that spot too. 

Oleg: Oh, hold on. 

Vika: Forty-five forty-seven is very dirty. 

Oleg: Quiet, quiet. Sorry.

Will: Yeah, but like, again…

Vika: I’d say no.

Oleg: No, no, no. Absolutely no. 

Will: Well, the next one would be twenty-one thirty-five. It has ninety-five thousand of whatever.

Vika: What?

Oleg: Okay…

Will: Forty-five forty-seven has one hundred twenty-five.

Vika: Yeah, but three indicators show over 50%: 70%, 70% and almost seventy. 

Oleg: Well, it’s at least 60% loss. 

00:21:32:21

Ashley: 60% water loss?

Will: Alright, alright. I give up.

Vika: Could you check, // please, forty…

Ashley: //So, it’s like mediocre, basically. 

Will: Which one?

Vika: Forty-eight forty-five.

Ashley: Yes. 

Salah: They said, forty-three twenty-seven. 

Oleg: We won’t even be able to clean it.

00:21:58:05

Ashley: Yeah. They are…As Salah said, they are saying that they are looking at forty-three twenty-seven. 

Vika: Forty-three twenty-seven – the water is pretty dirty but it’s passable. If Oleg will clean it, it’ll be possible to live with. 

Oleg: Hold on.

Will: Fuck! There is a lot of fucking water again. 

Ashley: Really?

Will: Yeah. 

Salah: It’s okay?

Ashley: //Forty-three twenty-seven?

Will: //Forty-three twenty-seven.

Vika: It’s way better. 

Ashley: //So, much better.

Will: //Forty-three twenty-seven?

Vika: Will you be able to clean it, Oleg?

Salah: //Forty-three twenty-seven.

Oleg: //Hold on. 

Will: Yeah. 

Salah: It’s okay?

Will: It’s amazing. 

Salah: For me it’s okay. 

00:22:29:14

Ashley: It’s fine for me. 

Salah: Vika?

Vika: It’s not good for me. It’s not the best,//but I like…

Ashley: //Someone said…

Oleg: Hold on. Hold on. 

Salah: Let’s agree it’s okay for all of us. 

Oleg: Well, 60% water loss. Let me…

Will: Yeah, but there is…

Vika: Well, this water is better than the previous one. //Previous one is a “No” for sure.

Oleg: //So, this is an A

Vika: But it’s // less than 50%

Will: //There is more, than in the last one they sent us. 

Ashley: So, it’s dirty but it’s possible to clean. 

Vika: It’s possible. //But it’s not the best option.

Will: //It’s so much. A lot of F [fucking] water. 

00:23:00:20

Will: Do you get it?

Vika: Seriously?

Will: Yes. 

Ashley: So, forty-three…

Oleg: It’s possible, but there will be 60% loss.  

Will: Yeah. Even with 60% loss there will be more than…

Ashley: So, forty-three twenty-seven is very, very, very, //[UI]

Will: //Yes, yes, yes. 

Ashley: Okay. 

00:23:18:24 – 00:24:19:06 

[no audio]

Vika: Forty-four twenty-eight. Forty-four twenty-eight. 

Will: Can we not?

Vika: Why?

Will: Because…

Vika: No water?

Will: The more you waste our time, the more surveys we have. 

Vika: Hurry up! 

00:24:38:07 – 00:25:50:24

[no audio]

Vika: So, forty-four twenty-eight. 

Will: 100% water loss. Ew! Forty-four…ah, forty-four twenty-eight. Not forty-four twenty-seven. 

Vika: Shut up!

Will: Okay, okay. 

Vika: Harry.

Will: Come on. Come on. 99% water loss. 

Vika: Where do you see it? Show me. Ew! What about this one?

00:26:20:26

Salah: Guys, you agreed on forty-three twenty-seven?

Will: I’m for it. 

Ashley: I’m okay with it. 

Will: A hundred percent. 

Salah: Drilling is asking. Operation also. They are asking about this point. Said, no. 

Will: Hm?

Salah: Who said no?

Ashley: Who said no?

Salah: About forty-three twenty-seven?

Ashley: I said yes. 

Salah: Vika?

Vika: It’s okay. One more time, which point?

00:26:54:21

Vika: Forty-three…

Salah: twenty-seven.

Vika: Oh, yeah. …Yeah, it’s okay. Oh, wait …Yeah, it’s okay, but not the best. 

00:27:17:14 – 00:27:28:28

[no audio]

Vika: What?

00:27:33:23 – 00:28:05:21

[no audio]

Oleg: What are you looking for?

Ashley: [UI]…I don’t know what it’s called. 

Oleg: [SL] pills?

Ashley: I don’t know. 

Oleg: It’s fine, don’t worry. 

Ashley: Did you take it?

Will: We haven’t even entered the signoff phase yet. 

00:28:31:05

Ashley: Where is your microphone even?

Oleg: Right here. Do you see it?

Vika: Why is it here? No one will hear you that way. 

Oleg: What do you mean they won’t hear me?

Vika: Ashley is the most important. 

Oleg: Well, if it’s pointed at Ashley then yes. 

Vika: At me. 

Oleg: Damn. You’ll be saying all kinds of things now.

Ashley: Did you seriously take my [UI]?

00:28:59:23

Oleg: Yeah, sure. Why the hell would I need it?

Ashley: Because you always take my stuff.

Vika: Ew!

Oleg: Why don’t you say that I wear it too? 

Vika: Because I thought about granny panties. 

Ashley: What?

Vika: Granny underwear. 

Ashley: Granny underwear?

Oleg: Damn. 

Vika: At least…I’d like… I’m kidding. 

00:29:31:21

Ashley: Oh, man.

Oleg: We tried hard to choose something nice, and you call it fucking “granny panties”. 

Will: What?

Vika: Not exactly. 

00:29:59:00

Vika: I developed a reflex to the Project RED and- TTB like Pavlov’s dog. I need to eat something when at TTB and RED. 

Will: Mhm. Exactly what I wanted //by the way. 

Ashley: //Alright. [singing]. //I think we’re ready to sign off.

Will: //When signoff phase starts. 

Ashley: Let’s do this. 

00:30:28:20

Ashley: For once, we all agree on their point. 

Oleg: So, which one did we agree on?

Salah: But where is the Signoff?

Ashley: They haven’t done it yet. 

Salah: Usually it’s [UI]

Ashley: They have to set it on their side. 

Salah: Oh, okay. 

Vika: Mm, actually, it’s so tasty. 

Ashley: Which one is it? Cranberry?

Vika: Tart cherry.

Ashley: Oh, tart cherry! Hmm. 

Vika: Mhm-m. 

Ashley: Better than compote. 

Oleg: Oh, here is also…

00:30:59:08

Oleg: Oh! Absolutely great.

Ashley: Which one?

Oleg: Eight thirty-nine… If there is water, it will absolutely be [UI].

Will: No. 

Oleg: Damn. 

Will: Too late. We decided already. So, like…

Oleg: Which one?

Will: Forty-three twenty-seven. We are just waiting for them to respond. 

Oleg: Is there enough water?

Ashley: //A lot.

Will: //Forty-three twenty-seven has the most. 

00:31:33:26

Oleg: Do we have any limit on excess of water?

Will: What do mean?

Oleg: Well, if there is more water than needed.  

Will: No. 

Oleg: No?

Will: No. It’s the opposite. The more the better.  

00:31:48:27 – 00:32:33:06

[no audio]

Oleg: What our colleagues from Chicago are saying? Did they agree?

Ashley: They are being quiet. 

00:32:45:19 – 00:33:43:08

[no audio]

Oleg: Will, how many gallons a day do you count on?

Will: For forty-three twenty-seven?

Oleg: Mhm. 

Will: One hundred and twenty-seven thousand. 

Oleg: Mm. 

Will: The other ones had: sixty, thirty-five, twenty-nine. 

Oleg: Is this before the loss?

Will: No. It is three hundred twenty-five thousand before the loss.  

Oleg: Mhm. 

Will: It can be as high as three hundred and eighty. 

Oleg: It is per day, right?

00:34:15:15

Will: Yes…So, we’ll just wait. Oh, fuck. 

Salah: Waiting for signoff or…

Will: There must be something wrong.  

Oleg: Is it because the chat is missing?

00:35:46:04

Will: Yes. 

00:35:47:29 – 00:36:17:17

[no audio]

Oleg: Is anyone filling out the calculators?

Will: What do you mean?

Oleg: Well, there is a discussion calculator on the right side. I see that when I’m putting my stuff in, others re putting it too. For example, the…the…hydroengineer, mechanical…

Will: Yeah. We don’t have that one. We have our own. 

Vika: It’s your team. 

Will: It’s your team. 

00:36:45:21 – 00:36:54:21

Ashley: Damn.

Salah: Anyone said…

Will: Hm?

Salah: Anyone said anything to you?

Will: No. [UI]…

Vika: //Fuck. I said “no”.

Salah: //Tell them: “Let’s sign off”, and let’s sign off. No one is replying. 

Ashley: //That’s what I keep saying. 

Oleg: Damn, I can’t take it out. 

00:37:46:22

Ashley: [SL] Pcherushka now. 

Oleg: Send it to NASA.

Oleg: Well, just out of curiosity – fourteen forty-eight. 

Will: No. 

Oleg: Fuck. 

Will: Why are you still looking?

Oleg: Well, I’m trying to find a perfect…some sort of pattern. 

Will: There will be a question. No, there won’t. 

00:39:02:18

Will: It will finally show. Okay, good. So, let’s take a look. Ah, no. 

Vika: Hm?

Ashley: Structural geologist…” I’m ready to marry”.

Vika: Huh?

Ashley: Did you see that? //In the team.

Vika: //Where is that?

Ashley: Structural geologist is like, “I’m ready to marry forty-three twenty-seven”. “blushes”

Vika: Where is it?

Ashley: In the geology team chat.

Vika: Oh. 

00:39:29:22 – 00:40:11:11

Vika: Not a bad picture. 

Will: What are you talking about?

Salah: You will run after?

Ashley: No, they gave me a message saying I’m not supposed to run.

Salah: Okay. 

Ashley: So, I think, Vika is gonna run after. I think she’s gonna take my spot, so she can run earlier. 

00:43:02:02

Vika: What?

Ashley: He’s asking me about running, and I said that they gave me a message saying not to. So, my spot is open for you guys. 

Vika: Yeah, I think it’s comfortable for me because after that I’m going to do Atlas. 

00:43:29:19 

Ashley: MTS party. At forty-three twenty-seven. What’s MTS?

Will: I don’t know. It’s just on there every time. 

Ashley: Oh, okay. 

Salah: What is it – “quite certain”?

Ashley: What?

Salah: Ah, okay. Okay. [UI] MTS party. And who set the name? Will?

Ashley: Yeah. He put “party” at forty-three twenty-seven. 

00:44:01:09

Salah: Yeah, but what’s MTS?

Ashley: He just said it’s always there. We don’t know what it is.

Salah: Let’s change it – SIRIUS.

Will: No. Hold on. Hold on. No, no, no. Don’t change it because I’ll…

Vika: [UI]

Ashley: Alright. Maintenance specialist why aren’t you putting your stuff in? 

Oleg: So? Are we confirming or not?

00:44:31:01

Will: Okay. Look at the name when you can.

Ashley: Hang on. I’ve got the stupid survey still. 

Will: Oh, damn. They just changed it back. You changed it,  why didn’t you tell me you were changing it?

Salah: You changed it also?

Will: Yeah, you’ll see. Oh, he won’t see. 

Ashley: What was…aww…

00:44:55:23 – 00:46:24:26

[no audio]

Will: Don’t change it to “William party” …because I now look at that like– “What?”

Salah: You can see it? How?

Will: It just changes…once you set a variable…

Salah: Now it’s again to Sirius. 

Will: Yeah. I put it back. 

Salah: You?

Will: Yeah. So, it’s not William, cause otherwise it’s like ‘What?’

Salah: Oh, okay. Just wait. Just wait. I want to check something. 

Will: If you change it, it will change it. 

Salah: Let’s see. Press…I moved one “s”.

00:47:00:07

Salah: Why is it not changing?

Will: Give it…it’ll take a sec. 

Salah: Are you sure it will change?

Will: Yeah. 

Vila: Hm. No. 

Salah: Let’s call it “Ew party”, huh?

Will: No, no, no. “Sirius party” is fine. Something…I’ll do it. MTS, that way it has MTS so they have their MTS.

00:47:33:12

Will: There you go. Now you should see it. Update. 

Salah: Oh, yeah. Okay. [UI]

Oleg: //Record it on your camera. 

Salah: Did you put MAG?

Will: Yeah. 

Salah: Oh, okay. 

00:49:29:29

Ashley: Fun fact – the diapers that astronauts wear are also called “MAGs – maximum absorbency garments”. 

Will: Nice. 

Vika: What? One more time. 

Ashley: The diapers…the heavy absorbency diapers that astronauts wear sometimes, they’re called “MAGs” as well. 

Vika: Oh. 

Ashley: Which are “maximum absorbency garments”. 

Will: [UI]

Vika: Okay. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Oleg: Again?

Will: Yeah, but hold on because if he rejected it…If he denied it for some reason, that means…

00:50:00:00

Salah: He wants to do something. 

Will: Yeah, so wait. Wait for him then. 

Ashley: Why the…who changed my decisions?

Oleg: Did they change yours?

Ashley: Yeah! What are they doing?

Will: Do you only need filter on third stage?

Oleg: Yes. 

Ashley: What? Who changed all my stuff?

Oleg: They changed mine too, and then put it back. 

Will: Fine. 

Salah: He’s changing, I think. 

00:50:31:10

Vika: Maybe they are just joking?

Oleg: Yes. When I opened mine, I looked at the…

Ashley: Why are they…Who changed it?! That really ups the costs. 

Will: Who has access to your variables? I can’t change them. 

Ashley: Who the heck?!

Will: Hm.

Ashley: Okay. Don’t move! I’m changing my stuff back. 

Will: Don’t choose the mechanical engineer on the relay task. Yeah. 

00:51:05:24

Oleg: Are you going to fight with them? Like, «Who changed my…»

Will: Are you sure that it’s them changing it or that there is some sort of error?

Ashley: I mean, the only people that can change stuff in human factors are our people. 

00:51:35:00

Ashley: I mean…

Will: Alright. Looks like they are signing off, so…

Ashley: Whatever. Fine.

Salah: Sign off, Vika. 

Will: If they are not gonna reject it. //[UI]

Salah: //Who? You still didn’t sign off. 

Will: I did, but they turned it off. 

Salah: Only Ash and mechanical engineer. 

Ashley: I’ll just sign off. I’ll just sign off. 

00:52:00:27

Ashley: I’m very upset by this. 

Oleg: Come on. You are the last one. 

Ashley: I’m doing it! I’m doing it! But I’m not happy! I’m upset right now! 

Will: Now we do what? DeChurch…

Oleg: So, did you just accept what they put for you?

Will: DeChurch nine. 

Ashley: Mhm-hm. Damn, I was the first one to put my decisions in.

Will: What?

Salah: //DeChurch nine.

Vika: //What?!

Ashley: //Nine.

Will: Let’s go.

Oleg: Ash is rebelling.

Vika: There is a fight. 

00:52:59:25

Ashley: What?

Vika: Fight. 

Oleg: Ash, are you crazy. 

Vika: Go on. 

Oleg: Is this acceptable?

Vika: It is necessary. 

00:53:31:13 – 00:59:15:10

[no audio]

Oleg: Really. But one more left. 

00:59:18:27 – 01:00:25:28

Oleg: The rest is hidden here. 

01:00:36:20 – 01:00:46:15

Oleg: You ate already. 

Ashley: [SL] What did you do?

Oleg: The button…

Vika: What did you do?!

Ashley: Did you really press something?

Oleg: Of course, not. Only once. 

Ashley: Oleg!

Oleg: I did not press anything.

Vika: He went to the bathroom.

Oleg: And who…

Ashley: Let me concentrate here!

Vika: Is it not enough that you almost ruined the research with the treadmill? So, now you…

01:01:14:28

Vika: Shame on you, commander! Shame!

Oleg: Fuck, I just wanted to press [UI] for her. //She told me that there is a toilet. [UI]

Ashley: //I’m not even eating right now. Don’t do it. Yeah!

Oleg: Can you believe it?

Ashley: I’m opening Relay. 

01:04:21:07 – 01:04:42:14

[no audio]

Ashley: So, the structural geologist. Does he do more, like, soil stuff around the area?

Will: No. It’s like …what? The property of the aquifer itself. 

Ashley: What is an aquifer?

Will: It’s an underground space that holds water. So, where the water is held in an underground area. 

Ashley: So the properties of the aquifer?

Will: Yeah. So, if you imagine, like, a big cave full of water underneath, it’s an aquifer. But it doesn’t have to be a cave. It could be another form. 

01:05:15:11 – 01:06:32:07

[no audio]

Vika: Triangle. 

Salah: Yeah, triangle. It is. 

Will: Stop talking, people.

Vika: //What do I….

Ashley: //What is…What’s the word?

Will: «Talk. »

Vika: «Communicate» is a word.

Will: «Communicate»?

Vika: Yes. Hello, friend! Hi! 

Will: Uh-huh. 

01:08:00:03

Ashley: It is a word, right?

Oleg: You better tell me how I can send you a letter. 

Will: No. No talking.

Vika: You can’t do that. 

Ashley: No. 

Will: What the fuck are you doing?

01:08:29:07

Vika: Fuck, I’m being attacked! 

Will: You deserve it. 

Vika: Yes. 

01:08:36:15 – 01:08:51:09

Ashley: Oh, crap! 

Will: Oh, no! 

Ashley: I’m an absolute idiot! I just sent something back to the person who just sent it to me. 

Will: They are probably gonna hunt you down and kill you now. 

Ashley: Probably. 

Will: You are gonna fucking die! Congratulations, idiot!

01:20:13:00

Will: “I can’t believe I did that! I’m literarily gonna go blow my own brains out right now! Fuck! I’m such an idiot!”
