Will: This.

Ashley: Okay. Camera is on, recording is on…Everyone?

Oleg: Everyone. 

Ashley: No, not yet.


00:00:38


Ashley: Good? Okay.

Salah: Red…Project Red, right?

Ashley: Yes. Today is January 25th, 2022, and it is mission day 82. The time is 3:25 PM. Three, two, one. //Mark.

All: //Mark.


00:01:01


Ashley: Alright. Let’s go ahead and connect.

Oleg: DeChurch…

Salah: Not Dechurch.

Ashley: No, not the DeChurch.

Oleg: Oh, not the DeChurch?

Ashley: Project Red Design.

00:02:10


Will: No…I heard about you. 

Vika: I heard about you. 

Will: It’s better when you say it. 

Vika: Do I sound like grandpa? 

Will: Yes.

Vika: I used to sound like grandma. [UI]


00:02:40


Will: Oh, yes.

Oleg: It’s off. The camera just turned off. Does yours turn off as well?

Ashley: No.
Vika: Eww…Why aren’t you eating? //Well, if you won’t eat it …

Salah: //Switch off the camera.

Ashley: [SL] Seriously? 


00:03:10


Salah: The sound from who?

Ashley: [UI]

Oleg: How about mine? 

Ashley: It’s okay. 

Oleg: I just turned it on again. It turns off by itself. Fine, let’s get to work.

Ashley: Are you laughing at me? With my message? No. 


00:03:41


Ashley: So where do you want to try out today, guys? Let’s see…

Will: Preferably somewhere where there is water. 

Oleg: [UI] Can you imagine that?  [SL] It’s two and seven again. 


00:04:04


Salah: Twenty-four fifteen. For me it’s okay. 

Will: Twenty-four…

Salah: Fifteen.

Ashley: It’s not great. Not great for me. A lot of red and orange zones. //Weather could be rough. 

Will: //A lot of water loss, but it does have water.


00:04:38


Ashley: What about thirteen four?

Will: One second. 


00:05:01


Vika: It’s better. 

Ashley: Alright. Progress. 

Will: [UI]

Oleg: I can’t get it to go online.

Ashley: And there…

Oleg: Well, I was there just now.

Will: What was your point, Ash?

Ashley: Thirteen four. 


00:05:31


Ashley: Did you try to connect and disconnect the internet or not?

Will: No water. 

Ashley: Oh, great.

Salah: Nineteen twenty-eight. 

Oleg: Well, here…

Ashley: Did you turn in off or…

Oleg: No.

Ashley: Well, turn it off and on right away. 

Will: [UI]. //What was yours again?

Salah: //Nineteen twenty-eight. 

Ashley: //Are you sure you did it right?

Oleg: //Well, of course. Here, I just did it again.


00:06:01


Ashley: What did you say? I’m sorry.

Will: Nineteen twenty-eight. A lot of water loss, but there is water there. 

Vika: No. [SL] A lot of contaminators. 


00:06:32


Oleg: Alright.

Ashley: Forty-eight twelve. Very high accessibility, high population reached, low red zones. 

Salah: What?

Ashley: Forty-eight twelve. 

Will: Complete water loss. 

Salah: Thank you. You saved my time. 

Ashley: Dick. Just kidding.

Will: It’s not my fault. I just went to school to be a sedimentologist. I don’t want to get yelled at. 


00:07:06


Oleg: [UI]

Ashley: When?

Salah: Check twenty-two thirty-two. Twenty-two thirty-two. 

Vika: Wow.

Ashley: I love it.

Will: You said twenty-two thirty-two, right?

Salah: Mhm

Will: Okay, that looks pretty good for me. That’s got a lot of water. 


00:07:34


Vika:  That’s okay. But what about…

Ashley: It doesn’t allow for a large //population.

Salah: //Other guys.

Vika: What about Oleg? Oleg, are you able to?

Oleg: Wait a second. Wait, I’m looking at it. 

Ashley: //When it comes to the number of people reached, it is literally the worst option.

Vika://Well, it doesn’t look like the worst option for me…

Salah: What is it?

Oleg: Oh, damn…

Ashley: Less than 4,500. We have 709 here. 


00:07:58


Will: This has so much water. It’s like… it’s so much. 

Oleg: //[UI]. It would be seventy, not seventy-four. 

Ashley: It does have good accessibility there, I will say. 80%.

Oleg: Well, there is 60% loss there. 

Salah: It’s perfect – 550.

Will: Okay. You’re good. You’re good. //So, you’re not good.

Oleg: //Is it too much?

Will: It is 120. The other have fifteen, thirty-seven…120,000 is a lot. 


00:08:29


Oleg: Well, no problem. Even with 60% loss we can…

Will: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is a lot.  

Oleg: That’s it. Good. And not too deep. 

Vika: Six point eleven.

Will: Okay. Six eleven?

Salah: So, it’s okay for four, I think. 

Oleg: Yes.

Will: Yeah. I have it marked down. 

Salah: Yeah, but keep it. 

Will: Yeah, it’s…

Salah: Maybe it’s okay with the other guys. 

Will: Yeah. 100% water loss. 

Vika: Okay. 


00:08:56


Ashley: I’m willing to make compromises

Will: Okay. 

Oleg: How about fourteen forty-four?

Ashley: Fourteen forty-four.

Will: Did you say fourteen forty-four?

Oleg: Yes. 

Will: Okay. No water. 

Oleg: Damn, it looks great for me. 

Vika: Thank you, Will.

Oleg: But it’s so clean.

Vika: I see it. So what?


00:09:35


Oleg: How about twelve forty-five?

Will: Twelve forty-five. No water. 

Oleg: [SL]Damn. Wherever it’s clean…

Will: It is clean because there is nothing there. 

Oleg: Well, then I’ll just wait to hear from you where there is water. 


00:10:02


Will: You… You may have a clean house, but if you don’t have a house…

Oleg: Well, yes. 

Will: Just a second…

Vika: Forty-four twenty…Forty-four twenty. 


00:10:30


Salah: Hm?

Ashley: Not bad.

Vika: Forty-four twenty.

Ashley: Not bad. Not the best, but still not bad.

Vika: For me it’s better than the last one. I mean twenty-two thirty-two.

Will: Which one?

Oleg: It’s the same.

Vika: Forty-four twenty. 

Oleg: Same as the previous one.

Will: Forty-four twenty…

Salah: Forty-two or forty-four?

Vika: Forty-four twenty.

Salah: It’s deep. 

Will: И большая потеря воды.


00:11:01


Will: 91%. A lot of water, but not enough to…

Oleg: So, pass on that?

Will: Yes. 

Vika: So, for now we have only twenty-two thirty-two.

Will: Yes.

Vika: Okay. 


00:11:31


Salah: Twenty-two thirty-two. If it’s the depth…If you have less depth, this is going to help for [SL] dimensions also. For their side. 

Will: That’s good. 

Salah: Five hundred eighty – depth. 

-

00:12:22


Salah: They are still sleeping. 

Oleg: Did they even start yet? We haven’t received any messages yet. 

Ashley: What about thirty-eight fourteen?

Oleg: Fourteen?

Ashley: Thirty-eight fourteen. Тридцать восемь четырнадцать.


00:12:54


Vika: It’s okay for me.

Salah: Okay for me. Okay.

Will: Okay. What is the…What is the number?

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: Thirty-eight fourteen. 

Will: Thirty-eight fourteen. Here we go. And we have…Not bad, not bad. 

Ashley: What??!!

Will: Pretty good. Let me…

Ashley: Okay. Maybe we add that to the list of possibilities?

Will: Yeah. 

Oleg: Yeah. Gorgeous.

Ashley: Wow!! Wow, guys!!


00:13:26


Oleg: One step would be enough for me.

Will: Oh yeah. It’s better than the other one. For me.

Ashley: Oh, here they are…So, which one should I offer them?

Will: Okay, let me…

Vika: Both.

00:13:56

-

00:14:26

-

00:14:46


Ashley: So, thirty-eight fourteen. And what was the other good one?

Will: Twenty-two thirty-two.

-

00:15:25


Will: Thank you…let’s just steal all of them. 


00:15:55


Ashley: One of them is saying: “Reporting from Dallas, Texas, y’all.”

Will: Nice. I just got fourteen twenty-nine.


-


00:17:22


Will: That was struct geo. [structural geologist]

Ashley: Hm?

Will: That’s my boy struct geo. [structural geologist]

Ashley: Maybe it’s a girl.

Will: I don’t know. 

-


00:18:39


Vika: What is “dunk”?

Will: Dunk is when you play basketball, you jump and just like that…

Vika: Oh…

Will: It’s //slang…

Salah: //There is Slam Dunk, right?

Will: Slam Dunk, right. It’s slang for…when you’re winning. As if I passed you and…like that.

Vika: Oh…Nice.


00:19:10


Vika: Let’s steal another chocolate. 

Will: Okay. 

Vika: [UI]

Salah: Is chocolate [UI]? [SL] No, I don’t know so. 

Vika: Hello. 

Ashley: It’s nothing. 


00:19:39


Salah: Everything is recorded, yes?

Vika: Who wants a candy?

Oleg: [SL] Duplicate. I’m surprised it wasn’t Ashley.  

Ashley: At least it’s not me. 

Salah: You pick up after we finish?

Vika: Don’t worry. It’s not the evening.

Ashley: It’s temporary, yes.

Vika: Yeah. 

Salah: [UI] Nineteen, yes? After you finish. Could you repeat that again? [UI]


00:20:09


Ashley: Yeah, yeah. 

Vika: We’ll clean up later. 

Will: Yeah, yeah.  [UI]

Vika: Okay, thank you.

Will: [UI]


00:20:35


Oleg: What do you think about six twenty-one?

Ashley: Six twenty-one.

Vika: Thank you, Will.

Will: [SL] No problem.

Ashley: Let’s…

Oleg: You’ll probably say there is nothing there.

Will: Well, let’s see. It’s not my fault. I can’t choose whether there is water or not. Which one, again?


00:21:00


Oleg: Six twenty-one.

Will: Six twenty-one. No water. 

Oleg: Wherever I see clean water…

Vika: That’s the reason it is clean…

Will: [UI]

Oleg: Huh?

Vika: What happened?

Ashley: No, thank you.


00:21:30


Will: What? I don’t know. It just stopped working. 

Salah: Not working?

Will: No. It just turned off. I don’t know what happened. 

Ashley: It’s got battery, right?

Will: Yeah. No, I think my [UI] [SL] pressure is on. It’s not a big deal.


00:22:06


Oleg: How about ten twenty-eight? There is definitely something there. 
00:22:27


Oleg: What?

Ashley: I’m just waiting to see what he says.

Vika: Works for me.
 
Ashley: It isn’t either bad or good for me. 

Salah: What is the point?

Ashley: Ten twenty-eight. 

Salah: Too deep. 

Ashley: Too…

Salah: One thousand seven hundred fifteen.


00:23:00


Will: How about thirty-eight fourteen? Did you say the water was bad there or…?

Ashley: No, it wasn’t bad. It was my point. 

Oleg: It’s good.

Ashley: Everyone said it was good. 

Will: What about you?

Vika: Wait a second…

Will: Thirty-eight fourteen.

Vika: It’s fine.




00:23:40


Vika: What? What is it?

-

00:24:00


Ashley: Well, the mechanical in here says that it seems to have minimal water depth. Wouldn’t that be a good thing?


-


00:26:33


Salah: Has low number output.

Ashley: They said twenty-seven thirteen. 

Oleg: Twenty-seven thirteen.  

Ashley: [SL] and nineteen. 

Salah: What they said?

Ashley: Twenty-seven thirteen to check out.

Will: It has 93% water loss. It’s too much. 

Salah: Twenty-seven?

Ashley: Twenty-seven thirteen. 

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: 93% water loss?

Will: Yeah. There is a lot of water but it’s not enough to compensate for that much water loss.

00:27:02


Salah: Oh, it’s too deep. Two thousand… They wrote for me: “Construction stability for twenty-two thirty-two is low. And thirty-eight fourteen has low number output.”

Oleg: What do we say about twenty-seven thirteen?

Salah: [UI]


00:27:29


Will: We lose 93% of water. So…

Oleg: And that it’s too deep.

Ashley: He says it’s too deep. I don’t know.

Oleg: What? Are we almost done?

Ashley: [whispers] [UI]

Oleg: Huh?


00:28:06


Ashley: Why is my team not replying to me, and engineering team is?

Oleg: Because you write to them, and they forward all your messages to me.

Ashley: No, but I write to the engineering team too. I’m the one who sends the messages. I write to everyone, but my team doesn’t …


00:28:31


Oleg: They didn’t wake up yet. 

Ashley: Yeah. 
-

00:29:19


Ashley: My team also did mention fourteen twenty-nine. //My team said…Did we?

Will: //I think we checked that one. That has 100% water loss.

Ashley: Are you sure?

Will: Yes. 

Ashley: Okay. 


00:29:57


[whispering]


00:30:19


Will: Ew. 

Ashley: So ew...

-

00:30:52


Will: Let’s all get tattoos of our symbols.

Ashley: What?

Will: Let’s do tattoos of the Project Red symbols. 

Vika: Here.

Will: Yeah, yeah. Like a new religion. 

Ashley: I feel like this is slow moving today. 

Will: Hm?

Ashley: I feel like this is slow moving today. 

-

00:33:40


Salah: Any reply from them? Hm?

Ashley: Not yet. 

Salah: Asked them from the beginning to know that we need response. This is [SL] me. 

Ashley: I guess they don’t like you. 

Salah: What about you?

Ashley: Okay. 

Salah: Huh?

Ashley: I got some but not…Hang on, let me show you. 



00:34:11


Salah: I’m doing the opposite. I’m asking them to give me the points and I will say if this works for me or not. You agree?

Will: I mean it’s always better to get whatever they agree on. They are still talking about twenty-two thirty-two and that definitely doesn’t work for them. So, I’m trying to be like …we need to move on to thirty-eight fourteen. [UI]


00:34:42


Salah: I got a response from drilling. 
Ashley: What did he say?

Salah: “Thirty-eight fourteen has low…no output” he said. 


00:35:10


Ashley: Sorry. 

Oleg: What’s up?

Ashley: She tickled my foot. 

Vika: No. I didn’t.

Oleg: Why can’t you sit still? 

Ashley: How do you say “ticklish” in Russian?


00:35:45


Will: Ticklish.

Ashley: Ticklish?

Will: Ticklish.

Vika: [singing Jaws theme] 


00:36:15

-

00:36:32


Salah: From their side twenty-nine two. 

Will: They are saying that five out of seven voted for thirty-eight fourteen. So, it isn’t bad.

Ashley: Five and what?

Will: Five out of seven. 

Oleg: So, it’s good.

Will: Let’s see what they say. What number?

Salah: Twenty-nine two. Drilling is saying from us. 

Will: 97% water loss. 


00:37:00


Salah: Good.

Vika: Thank you. 

Salah: 97%. 


00:37:32


Vika: Did we look at thirty-eight twenty-three yet?

Oleg: No.

Vika: Can you check please? Thirty-eight twenty-three.

Ashley: Thirty-eight twenty-three. 

Oleg: Twenty-three, right?

Vika: Mhm.

Salah: Good. 

Will: Not bad.

Salah: Good for me.

Will: Not the best one, but…


00:37:58


Ashley: It could work…Not the best, but it could work.

-

00:38:18


Ashley: What about Will?

Will: It works.

Salah: You have?

Ashley: Should we offer it?

Will: Yeah, I mean…Let’s see if they…yeah, I guess. I would say just if thirty-eight fourteen doesn’t work for y’all, this is also an option.

Ashley: Mhm.

Salah: Does it work for them?

Ashley: If...

Will: If thirty-eight fourteen //does not work.

Ashley: //does not work.

Will: Then…//thirty-eight twenty-three. 

Ashley: We try //thirty-eight twenty-three. 


00:38:52


Salah: But thirty-eight twenty-three works for you also?

Ashley: It’s alright. It’s not the best but it’s alright. 

Will: It’s not great. 

Salah: Yeah.


00:39:19


Vika: Did you all already make your…

Ashley: Grandma’s Basket? [this must be a funny nickname for something] 

Vika: Yeah. 

Ashley: Yeah, I did it. 

Vika: Okay. 

Ashley: Very-very delicious. Grandma’s Basket gives me energy and puts me in a good mood.

Oleg: I can tell you’re still feeling it.

Vika: That’s the reason…yeah. 

Oleg: You’re still in the mood.


00:39:48


Ashley: What?

Oleg: You’re still…how much did you drink?

Ashley: How much what?

Oleg: How much “basket” did you drink?

Ashley: How much “basket” did I drink? I don’t know. 

Oleg: Now.

Ashley: Oh, now? Nothing. 

Oleg: So, it looks like you’re in a good mood even without any. 


00:40:33


Oleg: It’s so unpredictable. It doesn’t really depend on where you put those points. Even if they are close to each other. 

Will: Okay. They are saying…Yeah…

-

00:41:03

-

00:41:27


Will: They are saying that it will probably be thirty-eight fourteen, but they want us to check twenty-nine two. I checked it. Too much water loss. I already messaged them.

Oleg: Twenty-nine two?

Will: We checked that already. It’s almost…so much water loss. 

Oleg: Oh, is it the one with 90% water loss?

Will: Yes.


-


00:44:30


Salah: What points do we have?

Will: We are just waiting for them to confirm thirty-eight fourteen. They will, I think. They just need to come to an agreement on this.
Ashley: [whispers] That was my point.

Will: Good point. 

Salah: Write Ashley [UI]

Ashley: Yeah. I want a flag with my name on it right there. 


00:45:00


Ashley: That things that get us excited in isolation. 

Salah: What do you say, “Yikis”? What’s “yikis?

Ashley: Yikes. 

Salah: What’s…

Will: It’s like “oh, that’s scary”.

Ashley: It’s like “eeew”.

Salah: Oh. 


00:45:24


Salah: When he told you, I thought: “Okay”. Can we see what they want? Does not work. Okay, I will show you [UI].

Ashley: At least you’ll give a reason. 

Salah: Yeah. 


-

00:46:15


Oleg: It’s taking them so long to decide. Are they working or not?
Salah: Till what time will we //work on this task?

Will: //They are probably discussing it.

Salah: No, no. I mean the time. One hour?

Ashley: I think, less usually, right? It kind of just depends on them. 

Oleg: If all these points…aligned with the crater …

Salah: Take a look at twenty-six thirty.


00:46:49


Ashley: They suggested that?

Salah: No. 

Ashley: Oh.

Will: Easy. No water. 

Salah: Good. 

Vika: [SL] Per. 


00:47:27


Salah: [SL] Did you ask Reynold what time we will be working on this task?

Will: What do you mean?

Ashley: Yeah, what do you mean?

Salah: I mean…

Ashley: This actual Project Red? How long?

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: Till the end of the mission. //That’s why every time he signs the radiograms, he says: “I’m sorry”.

Salah: //He don’t say anything. 

Will: I don’t mind it at this point. It seems like we have a clear idea of how to use the app. The crew is nice, I joke with them, I send them weird messages.

Oleg: This is supposed to last one hour, right?


00:47:56


Ashley: Did //[UI] have Project Red in his mission?

Vika: //It’s such a weird…I think that…

Will: Yes. 

Salah: //Last mission they have also?

Ashley: //Last mission they had more …more feedback.

Salah: The same way? They were selecting the point?

Will: Mhm.

Salah: From last mission they didn’t find any point.

Will: Well, the points are different. It randomly generates where water is.


00:48:37


Vika: It’s not fair.

Oleg: They were more active last time...

Ashley: Mhm.



00:49:00


Oleg: Right now, it’s only the mechanical engineer.

Ashley: Mhm. I know that Reynold said that there are two teams. They switch. [UI]


00:49:26


Oleg: There is nothing on fuel here. 

Will: [UI] about these. 

Salah: Hm?

Will: Nothing.

Ashley: My team has just totally abandoned me.

Salah: Huh?

Ashley: My team has totally abandoned me. 

Will: They must be having a heated discussion. 


00:50:00


Ashley: Through the interwebs also. Since they are not in the same city. 

Will: Are they not? I think the sedimentologist is separate from them. But I think the rest of them are mostly in the same room. I could be wrong. That’s what they said last time. But maybe that changes. [SL] [sings] I get big about these.


00:50:30


Oleg: Sanya, what is the best depth you have? Depth of the [SL] sea. Which?

Salah: Which one? Which…
Oleg: [PH] Okimo. 

Ashley: What’s the altitude?

Salah: One thousand. 

Will:  They are saying it’s thirty-eight. They are working on [UI], but it should work.

Ashley: Thirty-eight fourteen?

Will: Yeah.

Oleg:  I did it already.

Salah: They said something?

Will: Yeah, looks like thirty-eight…


00:51:01


Salah: Fourteen. 

Will: Thirty-eight fourteen. 

Oleg: Twenty-nine.

Ashley: Are you talking to the operations person?

Will: I’m talking about structural geo. 

Ashley: Structural…Struct geo. 

Will: Struct geo. What’s up?

Salah: [UI]


00:51:30

-


00:52:01


Will: Alright. Looks like we’re good to go.

Vika: [SL] Forty. 

-


00:53:00


Oleg: Did everyone put up their signal already?

Vika:  I think it’s after everyone signs. 

Salah: Who is in this group [SL] spaceman factors?


00:53:30


Ashley: Me and two people over there. Martian terrain and Martian…

Salah: Then why am I in this group?

Ashley: Because we can talk to anybody.

Salah: Well, okay. 

Ashley: I talk to all the teams. Just to annoy them. 


00:53:56


Ashley: [UI] to [SL] green. 

Will: Okay. Is everyone ready?

Ashley://I’m putting my stuff in.

Will: // Let’s do it all at once. Did you put your stuff in?

Ashley: No. I’m still working on it. It’s not working for me. 

Salah: What?

Ashley: Utility…[UI]

Oleg: What do you mean at once? Are we confirming?

Will: Wait for her to finish.


00:54:29


Ashley: And I need to look at what this is still. …fuck. Damn.

Oleg: What’s the issue?

Ashley: And you! I have to…

Will: Are you done? //Have you put everything in?

Ashley: //Damn!

Will: Have you put everything in for thirty-eight fourteen? Is everything good to go? You’re all done?

Salah: Yeah.

Ashley:// Three to red and hang on, hang on.

Will: //Okay. So, just wait a second.

Ashley: I need one more [UI] three to red. 


00:55:02


Ashley: Come on…Why does it look like [UI]? Oh, Jesus! Oh my God. Okay. 



00:55:32


Will: //Good to go?

Ashley: //I swear to God, this interface is not letting me slide things. I’m just going to go with what it has, I guess. 


-


00:56:13


Ashley: Okay. 

Will: Drill…

Vika: The name of the points. It’s fine.

Will: Drill person hasn’t put anything in yet. What the heck?


00:56:46


Ashley: What’s up?

Will: Why did I change the drilling? It’s not what I wanted. 

Salah: I think everyone they put their points, huh? Huh?

Vika: So, should we start?

Salah: Yeah. 

Will: Alright. Let’s hit that button. Are you good? Are you putting your stuff?

Ashley: I’m trying to change the last one. 

Salah: Should I click?

Will: Wait. Wait, wait. 
Ashley: Just give me a second. 

Salah: Only Ashley…

Ashley: I’m sorry. Okay. 

Vika: Oh, yeah.

Oleg: What can’t you figure out?

Salah: Drilling, you are ready. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: Did it break again?

Salah: //I’ll click, okay?

Ashley: //That’s fine. 

Will: //Yep. Everyone, click. 

Ashley: //Okay, I’ll just…let’s do it. 


00:57:17


Will: Yes. 

Vika: Guys, do you see me?

Ashley: No. 

Vika: [UI]

Salah: Even mine. Yes. 

Ashley: I see yours. 

Vika: Mine?

Ashley: No, his. Oh, now I don’t see yours. //Absolutely. 

Salah: //How come?

Will: Okay, that’s mine. So, it might just take a second. Here, I see yours. 

Vika: Mhm. 


00:57:48


Will: Now we just need structural geo and then yours will pop up at some point. There you go. We are good to go. 

Ashley: Struct geo?

Will: Except for…

Vika: I don’t see structural. 

Will: Yeah. My guess is that it’ll pop up here shortly. 

Oleg: Again? One more time?

Will: Uh-uh.

Vika: I see only structural.


00:58:18


Will: Okay. It’s odd.

Salah: Why they removed it?

Will: I don’t think they removed it. I think it’s just the system is finicky. 

Salah: Now it came back. 

Will: There you go. 




00:58:49


Vika: Do you see me?

Will: It’s kind of popping in and out. Mine is popping in and out. 

Salah: No. Sedimentologist also. 

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: Oh, yeah. Is mine not showing? Jesus!

Vika: What happened?

Will: Yours is…

Ashley: That’s weird. 

Will: But just give it a second to boot. It’s the process. 

Salah: Only Vika and operation. 

Vika: I did it already. I saw my sign. 


00:59:22


Ashley: Oh…

Salah: Oh…Vika why it was for everyone? 

Will: She didn’t. It’s just a weird glitch. 

Salah: Yeah.
