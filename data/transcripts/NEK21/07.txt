Ashley: Mhm. 

Vika: Okay. 

Ashley: Alright. Today is January 11th, 2022, it is mission day sixty-eight. The time is 3:25PM. Three, two, one. //Mark.

All: //Mark.

Salah: [UI]

Ashley: The password?

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: It’s funny that yours isn’t saved. 

Salah: I don’t know why it’s not saved. 

Ashley: Yeah, no worries. 

00:01:05:05 – 00:01:49:25

[no audio]

Oleg: Okay. What?

Will: Fuck. 

Ashley: What?

Will: I turned the camera off.

Ashley: Darn it. 

Will: But…

Ashley: It’s alright. You have a part one and a part two.

Will: Yeah. They can put them together.

Ashley: Yeah. …I’ve done it before. All good. 

00:02:25:08

Will: [SL] Look for…



00:02:28:07 – 00:02:57:08 

[no audio]

Oleg: I see that the points have changed a little in composition. And three thirty ... three thirty-nine. Look. I think it’s pretty good.

Salah: [SL] It’s a cycle. 

Will: Three thirty-nine?

Oleg: //Yes. Three thirty-nine.

Salah://The password. I will save it in a document. 

Ashley: Delta. Delta. Not the…it’s Delta. 

Salah: Oh, delta. 

Ashley: [SL] Lab.

Will: No. 

Oleg: No, right?

Will: //100% water loss.

Ashley: //All capitols. 

Oleg: Mhm. 

00:03:30:23

Salah: Okay…

Ashley: Lab org. 

Salah: [UI]

Ashley: [SL] Seven three, yeah. 

Salah: Thank you. 

Ashley: Uh-uh. 
Oleg: [SL] It’s good.

00:03:47:05 – 00:04:17:26

[no audio]

Oleg: On the platform, try to look, because where...It will be on the right side if you open the map completely. There are quite good approaches, but the water is deep. But at the same time, it is clean.

Will: Okay. Can you look at twenty-nine thirty-three? Twenty-nine thirty-three. 

Ashley: Twenty-nine thirty-three. 

00:05:01:11

Oleg: Yes. Cool. 

Will: Okay.

Oleg: Minimally contaminated.

Vika: //[UI]

Ashley: //It’s not bad. 

Salah: It’s deep. 

Ashley: How deep?

Oleg: What do you have?

Salah: One point five.

Ashley: What’s the max that it could be deep? For you to…

Salah: It has to be

Ashley: For you to be accepting it. 

Salah: no more than one point one. 



00:05:30:28

Ashley: In general, it may be.

Oleg: Yes.

Will: Okay. For Salah, is impossible, but…

00:05:43:28 – 00:07:25:01

[no audio]

Will: Twenty-eight twenty-nine. Twenty-eight twenty-nine. 

Oleg: No. I won’t be able to filter.

Ashley: That’s pretty good for me. 

Salah: Oh! The worst point for me.

Ashley: Yeah. It’s pretty good for me. 

Oleg: Too murky.

Vika: High contamination, yes.

Salah: See the depth?

Oleg: I won’t be able to filter. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Oleg: Ninety-one – it’s the absolute possible maximum.

00:08:01:13

Vika: I like point twenty-nine thirty-three.

Will: Okay, so. Twenty-nine thirty-three. Twenty-nine thirty-three.

Oleg: Yes.

Will: Twenty-nine thirty-three. Okay?

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: And it’s not okay for you, so…

Salah: It’s okay. 

Ashley: //It’s about the other one. 

Salah: //Which one?

Will: The previous one. 

Salah: Oh, the previous – no. 

Will: Okay. Okay. It’s okay. 

Ashley: To be honest, both of the points you’ve mentioned are pretty okay for me. 

Will: Okay, so, let me see [SL] what they…

Oleg: Are you suggesting it to yours?

Will: And you? You said twenty-eight twenty-nine…

Oleg: The water is too murky there.

Will: Okay. Okay.

00:08:30:17

Oleg: I won’t be able to filter it. At all.

Will: [SL] Alright. Okay. 

Oleg: Within seventy, the turbidity value I can still...it won’t get filtered.

00:09:08:08

Oleg: Are you suggesting twenty-nine thirty-three to your colleagues?

Will: Yes, yes, yes. I’m done. 

Oleg: For me, for some reason…

Ashley: Are they responding to you yet?

Will: Mhm. 

Oleg: Nobody has responded to anyone, right?

00:09:43:18

Oleg: They are celebrating.

Vika: [SL] In Russia, they are celebrating.

Ashley: Oh!

Oleg: Huh?

Vika: // In Russia, they are celebrating.

Ashley: //Our holiday time is over. 

Vika: Yes. 

00:09:53:21 – 00:10:28:06

[no audio]

Oleg: It would all be good, but it’s too deep. 

Vika: Hm. 

Salah: Check twenty-seven thirty-six. 

Will: [UI]

Salah: Last time the team in Chicago agreed on our point. 

Ashley: Yeah, at the end. Finally. It took them a while to get convinced.

00:10:59:23

Will: [SL] Okay. What did you say?

Vika: Oleg said it’s very deep. 

Oleg: Twenty two and eight. Well, if there is. I guess so. There is no criterion for evaluation //but I can see.

Salah: //[UI].  You are doing calculation, right, Will?

Will: Yes. 

Salah: So, okay. So, if anyone wants to suggest any point, [SL] tell us because we actually need to check some parameters before you do the calculation. 

Vika: So…

00:11:29:27

Will: Well, yeah. But I need to see if it has water at all. So, I mean…

Salah: Yeah, but the calculation takes time for you.

Will: Not really. I mean, it’s…

Salah: Yeah. 

Vika: Salah, could you check please, twenty-two eight. 

Salah: Too deep. 

Vika: Okay.

Salah: Three thousand six hundred. 

Will: Okay. //What was the one you said?

Ashley: //Human factors cost would be high too. 

Salah: Hm?

Will: What was the one that you said?

00:12:01:00

Salah: Okay. Twenty-seven thirty-six. 

Ashley: Okay. My team is responding. …What was…Sorry, what was the last one?

Vika: It’s a high level of contamination. 

Will: 100% water loss. 

00:12:43:27

Will: Okay. Twenty-one twenty. Twenty-one twenty.

Oleg: Quite possible. Yes.

Ashley: I mean, I can make it work. It’s not the worst. 

Will: Okay. 

Vika: It’s okay. 

00:13:14:15

Ashley: Slightly increased human factors cost but it could work.

Will: This is twenty-one twenty?

Ashley: Mhm.

Will: Okay. 

Vika: It’s okay.

Will: Okay. Okay.

Oleg: Yes.

Will: What about you? Does it work for you?

Oleg: Yes, quite. It’s //maximum loss. 

Will: //Okay.

Oleg: //40%.

Salah: So, let’s agree on one point. Huh? Twenty-one twenty.

Will: Yeah. Cool. [UI]

Oleg: Ash, take a look, it’s like search. 

Will: Twenty-three thirty-six. 

00:13:49:06

Oleg: Twenty-three thirty-six?

Will: Twenty… thirty-six. Twenty-three thirty-six. Twenty-three thirty-six. 

Vika: High level of contamination. 

Will: Okay.

Oleg: Yes. Well, the point is that there you can filter it. If there is something.

Will: There’s very little water. 

Oleg: Oh, then no.

00:14:20:07

Salah: Which one?

00:14:21:23 – 00:14:50:06

[no audio]

Oleg: How about twenty-five one?

Ashley: Twenty-five one.

Oleg: Yes. One. 

Vika: Great water loss. 

Will: Mhm.

Salah: Twenty-one twenty is good. 

Will: Twenty-one twenty is the best for us. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: Did you like twenty-five one that Oleg just said?

Will: Twenty-five…hold on. Twenty-five… which one?

Ashley: Twenty-five one. 

Will: Twenty-five one. Hold on. 

00:15:29:09

Will: Twenty-five…no water at all. 

Salah: It’s too deep. 

Oleg: But it’s clean. 

Vika: Relatively. 

Oleg: Well, if you compare with other ones. 

Will: We checked twenty-two zero eight, right?

Oleg: Yes.

Will: It was yours. 

00:16:01:06

Will: And, just in case, was it you who said no, yes? Did you say it or not?

Vika: I’ll check now. I have deleted it already.

Oleg: No. I, //on the contrary, said yes. Everything is okay. //The only thing that was said – it’s deep. Salya can confirm that.

Vika: //Twenty-two eight?

Will: //Twenty-two eight?

Vika: Oh, yes. //Salya said it was deep.

Ashley: //Twenty-two eight did not work for you, right?

Salah: Which one?
Oleg: //The depth is three thousand six hundred.

Ashley: //Twenty-two eight. 

Salah: Yeah, yeah. 

00:16:31:01

Salah: //It doesn’t work.

Will: //Did it work for you?

Ashley: It would be kind of expensive from a human factors side. 

Will: Okay, so, no then?

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: Okay.

Ashley: I mean, it’s …on one hand, it reaches a high population and it’s very accessible. It would just be more costly. So, I mean, we could make it work if it’s good for everybody. But…He says it’s deep, so…

Salah: Three point six. 

Ashley: Oh, three point six. Ooh, yeah, that’s really deep. 

00:17:02:23

Vika: Hm…

Ashley: //Does yours in the back actually say that one point one is the ideal depth in your boor or…?

Vika: //Two seventeen, please. Please check two seventeen.

Oleg: //Two seventeen?

Salah: Yeah... it’s about the calculation. 

00:17:29:23

Vika: Guys, can you please seventeen
Will: Two seventeen.

Salah: Because…

Ashley: Two

Will: Two seventeen.

Ashley: Seventeen. 

Oleg: Well…

Will: Very…93% water is lost. 

Vika: Okay. 

Oleg: And how about one and six? One and six. One six.

Salah: Which one, Vika?

Ashley: Two seventeen. 

Salah: Two seventeen. 

Vika: The main water collector has already said no.

Oleg: Okay…

00:17:58:26

Oleg: One six.

Ashley: My maintenance specialist says: “Twenty-eight twenty-nine does not work reasonably for maintenance. Can we try other points for now?”

Will: Yeah, I told them that [UI] twenty is the best for our end.

Ashley: Yeah.

Vika: Hm. One six. 

Will: Okay. Let me see. 

Vika: It’s okay. 
00:18:32:11

Will: Two seventeen, yeah…

Ashley: You don’t like that one?

Will: Two seventeen just doesn’t have enough water. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Will: The water loss is so high.

Ashley: Okay. //And what, Vika?

Will: //What do you say?

Vika: One six.

Ashley: One six.

Will: One six. 

Ashley: One six. 

Will: Okay. [UI] here. 

Ashley: It’s not bad. Possible. It could work. 

00:18:59:19

Oleg: Well, could work or is it yes? What don’t you like?

Ashley: It may work. There are //red weather zones.

Salah: //Not bad. But for you I will go “Okay”.

Ashley: It will…will increase…costs. More money.

Oleg: Will it cost more?

Vika: You are thinking only about money. 

Ashley: My whole goal is to reduce human factors costs //and increase accessibility.

Will: //So, one six is okay for you?

Salah: Yes, okay. 

00:19:30:11

Will: So, one six is not okay for you.

Oleg: I have…//yes, one six.

Will: //One six.

Ashley: //I’m, like, fifty-fifty on it. 

Oleg: It’s great for me.

Will: Great, okay. Is it okay for you?

Ashley: I’m a fifty-fifty on that.

Will: Okay. Alright. So, I’m gonna put you down as a “minus”, and then I’m gonna let them know that we’ve got four out of five. 

00:19:45:14 – 00:20:06:16

[no audio]

Will: Twenty-nine thirty-two. Twenty-nine thirty-two. Let’s…

Oleg: Twenty-nine thirty-two?

Will: Twenty-nine thirty-two. I’m checking now.

Vika: Is it a new one?

Salah: //Still, the best one is twenty-one twenty.

Will: //Yeah, structural geologist sent it to me. 

Ashley: Which one?

Salah: Twenty-one twenty is the best. 

Ashley: No. What did the structural geologist just send?
Will: Twenty-nine thirty-two. 

Ashley: Twenty-nine…oh, so, right near one of the ones that we just had. 

00:20:31:23

Will: Not bad. 

Vika: It’s a high level of contamination but hear Oleg. 

Ashley: It’s at lower accessibility. 

Oleg: Well, it’s okay.

Salah: Which point?

Vika: Can you filter it?

Oleg: //Yes, yes, yes.

Ashley: //Twenty-nine thirty-two they just sent. 

Vika: Okay. 

Oleg: It’s not a problem there.

Vika: For me, the worst thing is mineral and, just so cloudy...

Oleg: Ah, there’s seven there. Seven. This is removed during the first step.

Vika: Okay. So, it’s okay. 

00:21:01:13

Vika: For you, Salah?

Salah: Twenty-nine thirty-two?

Ashley: //Oh, fuck it.

Vika: //Yeah, really?

Oleg: Oh…

Vika: Oh, my God! I love this thing. 

Salah: Materials specialist, huh? Don’t forget. 

00:21:32:14

Salah: Oleg – biomedical, yes?

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: Biochemical.

Salah: Oh, biochemical.

00:21:37:06 – 00:23:05:03

[no audio]

Will: Okay. So twenty-nine thirty-two was fine. Twenty-nine thirty-two was okay for you?

Salah: Yes. 

Will: What about twenty-nine thirty-two for you? It’s okay? //Oleg, is it okay? 

Oleg: //Yes, yes. 

Will: For you? Okay. Okay. Twenty-nine thirty-two looks really good. 

00:23:30:00

-

00:24:00:09

Will: [UI]

Oleg: What are you saying?

Vika: Okay. Thank you. 

Salah: Vika, is there chocolate?

Vika: Yes, is it yours?

Salah: Yes. Thank you. So, we have two good points, huh?

Will: [UI]

Salah: I’m waiting for the reply from them. //Twenty…twenty-one twenty. 

Vika: //It’s gotten cold, I have goosebumps. 

Ashley: Hey, hey. Hey, Will, 

00:24:30:01

Ashley: Any chance, you can make a black tea too?

Will: Absolutely. 

Vika: No. 

Oleg: Fifty-five…

Will: [UI]

Oleg: //[UI]

Ashley: //I was eyeing that. I was like, “Hm, I wonder if we’re gonna open that.”

Vika: Oh, with nuts. 

00:25:00:13

Will: Do you want any sugar?

Oleg: //Please look at one sixteen.

Ashley: //No, just plain. Which one?

Oleg: One sixteen. 

Vika: Okay. 

Ashley: One sixteen. …It’s a cool spot. 

Oleg: Well, finally, // although I heard from you…

Vika: High water loss.

Oleg: Can you believe it! 

00:25:30:10

Oleg: We just started getting clean water, and immediately…

Vika: Darn…

Will: [SL] Cool. Okay! Which one was it?

Oleg: That was one sixteen, but now, if there’s water loss there…I’ll tell you now.

Will: So, it is a no, right?

Oleg: Well, no. For me, it’s yes. It’s cool. 

Vika: //Great water loss.

Will: //One sixteen.

Oleg: Yes, one sixteen. 

Ashley: Three…

Oleg: The water is clean there. 

00:25:59:12

Ashley: One sixteen - //cool.

Oleg: //Or six twenty-one. 

Will: There’s no water there at all.

Oleg: Darn! //Six twenty-one.

Ashley: //They…they here //say the twenty-one twenty that we suggested is the best point for them.

Vika: //The word “fuck” was said in error. Mm…cool. 

Will: Twenty-one twenty.
Ashley: Mhm. 

Will: Okay, cool.

Ashley: They said that’s the best point for them. 

Will: Okay. Alright, so, do we have an agreement?

Salah: Who said?

Ashley: Oh, wait. That was you. Never mind. 

Salah: That was me. 

Ashley: Oh, fuck. Never mind. 

Vika: Six twenty-one – great loss of water.

00:26:30:15

Ashley: Never mind. That’s him. Exinite that. 

Will: Okay.

Ashley: I forgot. 

Salah: Is that you? Martian…

Ashley: Yeah, of course. 

Salah: Yeah, I’m supporting you. Okay. That’s why I’m writing. 

Vika: Me too. What are you talking about?

Salah: The last chat.

Will: I said, that twenty-nine thirty-two is good for us, and…

Vika: Mhm.

Will: [UI]. Okay. 

Vika: //[UI]

Will: // Twenty-nine thirty-two, I told them. I told the operation

00:27:01:24

Will: To ours, too.

Vika: Oops.

Oleg: Oh //one thirty-one.

Salah: //Will is sedimentologist, I think.

Ashley: Mhm. Yep. 

Will: They say twenty-one twenty is bad.

Vika: Okay.

Oleg: One thirty-one. 

Will: No water.

Vika: Great water loss. 

Oleg: I just can’t believe it! 

00:27:30:22

Vika: [SL] Water drinker.

Oleg: I just now showed Ash, all the places where I have clean water, it’s just like that, simply, it’s not there, damn it. Everything else is…

00:27:57:25

Oleg: Eleven thirty-six. Darn, there…

Ashley: Eleven thirty-six. 

Oleg: Just say that it’s not there, darn. 

Vika: We’ll say it now. Everything you want. 

Will: Which one?
Oleg: Eleven thirty-six. 

Vika: High water loss. 

Oleg: [UI]

Ashley: Not so bad for me. 

Salah: Oleg [UI]

Ashley: When I have…

Vika: Everything for you.

Oleg: No.

Vika: Everything for you.

Will: You understand, there can’t be much, because there is no water at all.

00:28:29:16

Salah: Camera is off. 

Ashley: Really?

Salah: [UI]

Ashley: See my face right away. It’s like “What?!”. They are suggesting forty-one eleven. 	They are suggesting forty-one eleven. 

00:29:00:16

Salah: We tell them: “Very bad”.

Vika: Hm? For you?

Salah: Forty-one?

Ashley: Yeah, forty-one eleven. Where is it? Oh, fuck. I gotta…forty-one eleven.

Vika: No. …High water loss. 

Salah: Hm. 
Will: Which one?

Vika: Forty…

Salah: It’s deep.

Will: Forty…

Vika: Forty-one eleven. 

Ashley: Okay, so, //too deep, 

Will: //one…

Vika: Eleven.

Will: Eleven. 

00:29:29:17

Salah: Sorry. 

Ashley: Forty-one eleven. 

Salah: Big No. 

Oleg: Okay.

Will: No water. 

Oleg: Darn!

Ashley: Okay. I’m gonna tell them that. …You said, there is no water, right? “Because no water, too deep, [UI]

00:29:58:01

Vika: For you, too? Hmm…strange. You have an error here. 

Oleg: Oh, here. This one we…thirty fifty. It’s just wonderful. I think everyone will like it. 

Will: Thirty fifty. Okay.

Oleg: Yes. 
Ashley: Thirty fifty?

Oleg: Yes. Thirty fifty. Let’s take it and go. 

Ashley: Thirty

Vika: Are you taking it?

Ashley: fifty. 

Will: You or I first? There’s no water there. 

00:30:28:21

Oleg: I’m not sure. So what? At least…

Vika: Yes, Oleg. High level of water loss.

Oleg: Fuck. Play it safe, right? Oh! It’s just gorgeous – thirty-five fifty. And everything, without looking, we take it.

Ashley: Thirty-five fifty?

Oleg: Yes. 

Vika: [SL] Yes, okay, just like that. 

Oleg: What can I suggest?

Vika: Will you look, Will? Or should I look?

Oleg: Darn. No one will be looking at anything now. 

00:30:59:01

Vika: Yes. [UI] Oops, out of habit I added drilling. …Do we have some candy?

00:31:15:13 – 00:31:46:09

[no audio]

Oleg: We need to find a map of water, where there is some to begin with. And then evaluate its quality.


00:31:55:13 – 00:32:38:09

[no audio]

Oleg: Forty fifty, fifty fifty.

Salah: They are saying, forty-one eleven works for them.

Will: Yeah.

Salah: “Twenty-one twenty really does not work for our maintenance specialist.”

Vika: Yeah, okay, but…

Salah: But it’s not working for us also. 

Will: //Twenty-one twenty?

Vika: //But twenty-nine…

Salah: No. Forty-one eleven.

Will: Yeah. We let them know. We just have to wait until they hear it. I mean, they probably haven’t even gotten our messages yet. 

Salah: Hm.

00:33:03:05

Vika: And twenty-nine thirty-two. 

Will: Mhm.

Salah: Twenty-nine thirty…

Vika: Yeah.

Will: Yeah. 

Salah: Yeah. This is good for us. 

Vika: Okay. Perfect. 

Will: [SL] Yeah. I told them. 
Vika: So, Oleg. Thirty-five fifty – high water loss. 

Oleg: Thirty fifty. 

Vika: We had thirty-five fifty.

Oleg: No.

Vika: No? Thirty fifty? Let me look. 

Oleg: And then…

00:33:43:11

Vika: Same. 

Oleg: And there’s also fifty-fifty on this line. It’s just wonderful. Pure water. [UI] don’t want.

Ashley: And, sorry, the forty-one eleven was too deep, no water

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: And couldn’t be…too contaminated, I guess. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: Is that what it was. 

Will: There is no water. 

00:34:10:06

Will: Eighteen thirty. 

Salah: Just tell //them there is no water because even if it’s not deep, there is no point, you know?

Will: //Eighteen thirty.

Oleg: Mhm-m. 

Vika: I like it. There are soluble for me… High… high contamination, //but

Salah: It’s too deep. 

00:34:41:29

Vika: soluble in the first. If you can filter it, then I agree.

Oleg: Darn. Here, one stage would not be enough. 

Vika: Hello. Do you want this now?

Will: So, for you – yes. Eighteen thirty?

Vika: I don’t agree until our bioengineer says. //If Oleg filters...

Will: //I’m not asking. You know, like, does it work or doesn’t it work. I was just asking for the amount.

00:35:11:29

Vika: Fifty fifty. 

Oleg: It will be very difficult for me to clean it, because...

Will: So, then no, right? Okay.

Vika: No, it means, no. 

Will: And this one for you? For yours?

Vika: Not for me either, then. Because he will not be able to filter, and there is high contamination.

Will: I’m not asking about him. He has already given me his opinion. So, about yours.

Vika: No. No, no. 

Will: No? Okay. Eighteen thirty?

00:35:33:27 – 00:36:01:27

[no audio]

Oleg: Although, for this one, maybe you can try. 60–70% of the loss will be just during filtration.

Will: Well, there’s a lot of water there. I’m just collecting this. I always have a list

Oleg: where possible.

Will: points where there is something. Type, pros, cons. So I need to know //to whom [UI]

Oleg: //Well, in short, here it is – only 40% will remain.

Vika: //Salah, thirty-eight twenty-two.

Will: Let’s, okay. 

Salah: Thirty-eight

Oleg: In the best case scenario. 

00:36:29:23

Will: So, this is, just, //not good at all. I have – minus.

Salah: //Twenty-two. 

Vika: //Yeah. 

Oleg: Yes. 

Will: In your spot. Eighteen thirty?

Salah: It’s deep. 

Will: Okay. 

Salah: The eighteen thirty is normal. 

Will: Okay, good. Then that’s a plus. Okay. 

Vika: So, thirty-eight twenty-two is deep?

Salah: Yes. 

Will: Thirty-eight twenty-two?

Vika: Mhm.

Salah: Yes. 

00:37:00:19

Will: Not bad. 

Vika: But it’s deep for Salya. 

Will: But it was good for you, yes?

Vika: Yes. And I think for Oleg, too. Oleg, check thirty-eight twenty-two [check] please.

Oleg: Thirty-eight twenty-two, yes?

Vika: Mhm. Ash, could you check please?

Ashley: Mhm.

00:37:37:09

Oleg: Mhm.

Will: Thirty-eight twenty-two?

Vika: Mhm.

Will: Is it good for you?

Vika: Yes. 

Will: It’s okay for me. Is that okay for you?

Ashley: Weather is not great there. // There is a lot of red zones, a lot of orange zones. 

Will: //Okay, so…And you?

Salah: Which point?

Will: Thirty-eight twenty-two. That’s too deep, right?

Salah: Thirty-eight?

Will: Thirty-eight twenty-two.

Salah: Yes. It’s deep. 

Oleg: Darn.

Will: Oleg, for you?

Oleg: Hold on, I’ll finish calculating now. 

00:38:01:21

Oleg: So, this and there’s one more here…Yes. 40% loss. Okay. 

Will: They said: “Yes, twenty-nine thirty-two – it’s bad”.

00:38:31:06

Ashley: Is there any water at sixteen nineteen?

Vika: Sixteen

Ashley: Sixteen nineteen. Is there something good for you there?

Will: No. 

Vika: You didn’t even give a chance. There are great losses there. 

Ashley: Well, okay. Okay. 

Will: So, thirty-eight twenty-two, at the end, you said…

00:39:01:11

Salah: Yes.

Will: Oleg, what are you…

Salah: //Thirty-eight twenty-two.

Ashley: //I said that it was a lot of red and orange zones, so the weather is not great. But I mean…

Vika: //Oleg said yes. 

Will: //Okay.

Salah: Which one?

Ashley: Thirty-eight twenty-two.

Oleg: I told you that it’s 40% loss. 

Will: Mhm. Is that thirty-eight twenty-two we just checked?

Vika: Yes

Oleg: Yes.

Will: Okay. 

Salah: [SL] Twenty-one twenty-two. They are saying forty three. 

Vika: Hm?

Salah: They are sending: “Try four…forty-three.

00:39:40:22

Will: Okay.

Vika: [SL] Blah…

Will: 100% water is lost 

Salah: No water, huh? Good.

Will: There is water, but you’ll lose it all. 

Vika: Forty-three?

Will: Forty zero three. 

Vika: It’s high contamination there...If you can filter it, it may work.

Ashley: //So, you’ll lose it, like, during the drilling process?

00:40:02:04

Will: There is some…it’s just, like, over…//it’s not during the drilling process it’s just that the…loss between…there is, like, two different types of reservoirs, and when they sit up next to each other in a weird way, what ends up happening is that over time the water basically flows from one to the other. So, you’re drilling into one, but it loses it. So, you can’t…

Ashley: //Asking him. 

00:40:29:29

Ashley: Okay.

Will: You won’t actually have access to that water. 

00:40:32:20 – 00:41:19:07

[no audio]

Vika: An hour already? Oh, forty minutes just flew by. 

Salah: Did you get any reply for point twenty…twenty-nine thirty-two?

Ashley: Yeah, I think, they said that was one of the top runners for them. Hang on.

Salah: What they said?

Ashley: One second. I need to look back. 

Salah: Okay. 

00:42:41:14

Ashley: Where was it? They said that twenty-nine thirty-two works for all of them. 

Will: Wait, what?

Salah: Yeah. Even for us. 

Ashley: Wait, wait, wait. Never mind. No, no! Fuck! I keep messing up! I keep forgetting that’s you. Hang on. 

00:43:07:19

Ashley: Mechanical engineer says, his personal…the best points are: twenty-nine thirty-two, twenty-one twenty, forty-one eleven. We exinite forty-one eleven. 

Will: What did he say?

Ashley: The best points are twenty-nine thirty-three, twenty-one…

Will: Twenty-nine thirty-three?

Ashley: Yeah.

Salah: Thirty-three? Not thirty-two?

Ashley: That’s mechanical engineer speaking. 

Will: Okay, let me check it. 

Vika: Twenty-nine thirty-three?

00:43:30:14

Ashley: Yeah. 

Vika: It was the first point. 

Ashley: That was like the first one that we had mentioned. 

Vika: Yeah, yeah. 

Salah: Yeah.

Will: Twenty-nine thirty-three? //Oh, yeah. 

Vika: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Oleg: We said that at the very beginning.

Vika: And it was good. 

Oleg: Then //twenty-one twenty.

Ashley: //And then twenty-one twenty. 

Salah: It was deep. 

Vika: Oh, deep for you. Okay. 

Oleg: Forty-one…

Ashley: He is also suggesting more points. So, mechanical engineer says forty-four twenty and eleven thirty. So, forty...forty-four twenty first.

00:44:02:20

Will: What was it? Forty…

Ashley: Forty-four twenty.

Will: Forty-four…An error occurred. 

Ashley: Oh. 

Will: Oh.

Vika: It’s //not bad, but in case Oleg could clean it. 

Ashley: //I just got that too. 

Oleg: I’ll check now. 

Will: Loses almost all of its water. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Will: //So, forty-four twenty.

Oleg: //Again, it goes beyond…

Ashley: Another option they’re suggesting right now is eleven thirty.

00:44:34:10

Vika: [UI]

Ashley: Eleven thirty is another option they suggested here. 

Oleg: Dirty…Well, we are again beyond 60%.

Vika: Yes, it’s very high. 

Ashley: Oh, I like eleven thirty. I like eleven thirty very much. 

Will: Eleven thirty…Fingers crossed. Not…
00:45:00:14

Will: It’s not a lot of water but it’s workable.

Ashley: Okay. Okay. What about you?

Salah: Water depth – one point seven. 

Ashley: It’s not the worst. Could be worse. 

Salah: For you, huh?

Vika: It’s not the best point. 

Ashley: Fair enough. Okay. 

Will: Yeah, it’s the lowest end of…

Ashley: So, if we were to rank…

Salah: Twenty-nine thirty-two is the first one

00:45:30:11

Ashley: Okay. 

Salah: Twenty-one twenty is the second

Vika: Twenty-nine thirty-three was the first one. 

Salah: Thirty-two. 

Ashley: Well, so, they are suggesting thirty-three now. I mean, as the point that they like. Our first point, yeah. Like Vika mentioned, so I don’t know. 

Will: Okay. 

Salah: Did you get a…because I’m asking about twenty-nine thirty-two. I didn’t get any reply. Did you?

Ashley: Oh, I’m talking with the engineering team.

Will: Twenty-nine thirty-two, yes. That’s a No from the operations specialist. 

00:46:01:13

Ashley: But thirty-three was okay?

Will: thirty-two.

Ashley: Okay. 

Will: Thirty-three – I think they suggested that. 

Ashley: Well, that was the first one that we suggested. 

Will: Okay, but they are coming back. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Will: And sending back to us. 

Ashley: So, like...was that one better for everybody than…

Will: That one is good for me. But…

Ashley: Was it better or worse than twenty-one twenty?

Will: We hit three out of five on that one. 

Salah: Mhm.

Ashley: And twenty-one twenty hit most of us. Didn’t it?

Salah: And twenty-nine thirty-two.

Will: Twenty-one twenty had all of us. 

00:46:30:10

Salah: And twenty-nine thirty-two.

Ashley: I thought, he just said that thirty-two was exinated. 

Will: Thirty-two…twenty-nine thirty-two, they said no.

Salah: What? When? Twenty-nine thirty-two?

Will: Yep. 

Ashley: It’s getting confusing.

Oleg: There. Still eleven thirty, if…

Will: Umm…yeah. 

Oleg: Very bad?

Will: Twenty-nine thirty-two.

Ashley: For me //it would be okay.

Will: //They said no.

Ashley: I like eleven thirty very much. 

Oleg: What do you think of eleven thirty?

Will: Eleven thirty – it…

Vika: It’s deep. Salah said, it’s deep. 

Will: works,

00:47:00:15

Will: but, like, I don’t know…how much water…

Oleg: Too little?

Will: Little. So, like…

Ashley: Could it be a third-place runner?

Will: //[UI] runner. 

Oleg: //For me, it provides clean water. Good water.

Ashley: Fair enough. 

Will: Yes. So, for me that’s a “No” but for you…

Ashley: So, like, first place…For me eleven thirty was really good. 

Will: Eleven thirty is really good. Okay. Eleven thirty was too deep for you?

Salah: Yes. Deep. 

Will: And what about Oleg?

Oleg: Which one?

Will: Eleven //thirty.

Ashley: //you like thirty very much.

Oleg: For me, yes. I have…

00:47:29:26

Vika: Not the best point, but yes. Why not?

Salah: [UI]

Oleg: I have a maximum loss of 40%, but it’s good for that.

Will: Now we’re just waiting for their response to our questions. Ah...twenty-nine thirty-three we’re ready now, right?

Vika: Yes. I – yes. 

Will: If they say…

Ashley: For what?

Will: If they say they are ready to go for twenty-none thirty-three, then we’re good to go, right?

00:48:01:09

Ashley: Mhm.

Oleg: Now again. Twenty-nine thirty-three. I’ll check again. No, well, that’s fine. How does it work here? Twenty-nine…

00:48:29:18

Ashley: There are some…We already checked twenty-eight thirty-two, right?

Salah: They are saying, thirty-eight twenty-two. 

Oleg: Eleven thirty was rejected. Too expensive. 

Salah: Thirty-eight twenty-two. 

Oleg: Is that you, by any chance, who is making decisions about money? 

00:49:01:13

Will: Which one is it? Which one did they want us to check?

Oleg: Eleven thirty.

Will: Which one did they want us to check?

Salah: Thirty-eight twenty-two. 

Ashley: We already checked that one before. 

Salah: I don’t know why they repeated. 

Ashley: I mean, that’s like fifty-fifty for me. 

Salah: Yeah. Me too. 

Will: Thirty-eight twenty-two. Yeah, that was fine for me. Yeah, we had three out of five on that one. 

00:49:30:00

-

00:50:00:01

Will: Mmm. 

Oleg: Ah, it’s the meteorologist who’s screwing things up here. … Eleven thirty isn’t ideal for us?

Ashley: Eleven thirty? I think we said it could work, but it’s not ideal.

Oleg: Ah, yes. Thirty-eight twenty-two. 

00:50:31:21

Will: What is this five and five [UI]. Oh, it’s this thing, yes?

Ashley: Mhm. 

Vika: Mhm. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Vika: Fuck. 

Salah: They said: “Thirty-eight twenty-two is very good for us”.

00:51:00:15

Salah: Do you guys have opinions?

Will: Thirty-eight twenty-two?

Salah: Yeah, the one we checked. The last one. 

Will: It’s fine for me.

Vika: Yeah.

Will: Three out of five.

Vika: It’s good.

Will: Yeah, yeah. 

Ashley: It was a //fifty-fifty for me. It would be more costly because the weather there is not perfectly ideal.

Vika: //It’s okay. 

Will: Say that we will accept that point. 

Ashley: Just know that the human factors costs will be high. 

00:51:23:18 – 00:52:21:01

[no audio]

Will: When did you…okay. That was a while ago. You sending about checking for twenty-nine thirty-two. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Will: They’ve already moved on. 

Salah: [UI]

Will: Alright. Now we wait. Doesn’t want. Mhm. Thirty-eight twenty-two is our deal. 

Vika: Mhm.

Will: Then, let’s go. Smash that “Like”.

00:53:04:04

Ashley: Reaches a lot of people. …So, that’s good. 

Oleg: So, it turns out seven…

Ashley: Accessibility is high. Mhm. Very high actually. Okay. Thirty-eight twenty-two?

Will: Yeah, I told them that we are…

Ashley: Let’s do it. Let’s do it, do it. 

Will: we’re ready to party.

00:53:30:21

Ashley: So, let’s calculate here. So //green zones. 

Salah: Yeah. Thirty-eight twenty-two. It’s agreed. 

Ashley: So, green. [UI] is twice as much as [UI]. [UI]

00:53:43:28 – 00:54:10:01
[no audio]

Oleg: In terms of water, is there something there?

Vika: Thirty-eight twenty-two?

Will: Did you add…did you move to sign off?

Salah: No, still. 

Will: Huh?

Salah: No.

Will: Yeah. Everyone at Sign off, to add their things, just in case? Wait. You don’t need to do it.

Vika: Yes. 

Ashley: Wait. Why can’t I select my option?

Will: [UI] did too.

Vika: Should we wait, or we can…

00:58:01:13

Ashley: No, no, no. Don’t sign off yet. 

Will: We can’t sign off. We have to wait for them. 

Vika: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. 

Oleg: Sign off?

Will: Salah needs to sign off and then we’re waiting for…he is// adding stuff, not sign off. 

Ashley: //Yeah. I still…

Will: And then, operation specialist needs to…

Vika: But I can? “You are about to sign off on…”

Will: Don’t sign off. Don’t sign off. Do not do that. Okay?

Vika: Okay. 

Will: No.

Ashley: Do not do that!

Will: We are waiting for [UI].Okay, good.

00:58:33:01 – 00:59:05:19

[no audio]

Salah: Who signed off?

Ashley: Who did it?

Vika: Maintenance, operations specialist…

Ashley: Did everyone finish putting their stuff in? Oh, looks pretty filled out. 

Salah: Should we sign off now? Hm?

00:59:30:16

Will: If you put your stuff in. 

Salah: Yes. 

Ashley: One of my values changed. That’s not correct.

Will: Got it. Okay, cool.

Will: Why doesn’t it want to do it?

Salah: Error. Error. 

Oleg: Yes, for some reason it doesn’t want to do it. 

01:00:00:01

Vika: It wants to do it. That’s it. Don’t click anymore.

Oleg: Registered? No.

Vika: Now it disappeared. Wait a second. …Try again. 

Oleg: [SL] No. It falls down for me. 

Salah: Yes. 

Vika: I don’t see you. 

Salah: Oleg and Will.

Vika: I like this part. 

Ashley: Yeah, me too. 

Will: Now we have DeChurch nine. 

Ashley: Mhm.

Vika: Mhm.

Oleg: And does anyone see in sign off the overall result of the effectiveness of the point? Or just each one...

Vika: Yes, it’s an interesting question. Forty-nine or…

Ashley: DeChurch nine. 

Vika: Oh, DeChurch nine. Thank you, guys.

Ashley: Mhm. Mhm. Okay

01:01:31:12

Ashley: So, //let’s do DeChurch nine.

Vika: //DeChurch nine. Nine. //Nine!

Oleg: And why nine?

Vika: So…

Ashley: Because 

Salah: We switch off the camera?

Ashley: No.

Salah: When?

Ashley: After relay. 

Salah: Mhm. DeChurch nine, huh?

Ashley: Yes. 

Oleg: So…
