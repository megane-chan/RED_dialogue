Transcript


Ashley: Do you have yours on?

Vika: Stinky!

Will: Stinky!

Salah: Huh?

Ashley: Is your recorder on?

Salah: Yes.

Ashley: Okay, cool.

Will: You’ve got to start the video eating. That way they are not like, “Oh, they started eating during the video”. Like, you already started the video and you’re eating already. 

Ashley: Alright, alright. So, today is May 3rd, 2022. It’s mission day 180. The time is 2:28 PM. Three, two, one. //Mark.

All: //Mark.
00:00:32:21

Will: Some people are not amused. Mhm-m. Dang it! 

Ashley: I just saw your message, Will.

Oleg: [SL] Where is it? …Again this…

Will: It happens. It happens. 

Vika: Mhm.

Oleg: It’s acting up again. 

00:00:57:14 – 00:02:05:11

[no audio]

Ashley: Alright. Let’s work it out today. 

Will: Give me a number. 

Vika: Motherfucker! 

Will: No! No! 

Vika: Yes. 

00:02:30:27

Will: Thanks, Vika! That’s what I wanted. Cookies all over the fucking keyboard. Jesus! 

Salah: No pistachio today, huh?

Will: Apparently not. Because they would be all over my keyboard. ...They are gonna love this one. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Vika: Yours doesn’t work either??

Oleg: Oh! It is working. 

Will: Fuck!
Oleg: There it is. 

00:03:00:10

Vika: Oh, hey! 

Oleg: All…fifteen points appeared at once. 

Ashley: I have one for you…

Oleg: Twenty-five thirty-one.

Will: Come on! Let’s go! Let’s go! Give me a number!

Ashley: Thirty ten. 

Vika: No. 

Will: Thirty ten. Let’s see what she got for me here. No water. 

Oleg: And…

00:03:30:11

Oleg: Twenty…

Salah: Too deep. 

Oleg: //Twenty-five thirty-one. 

Ashley: //Damn it! 

Will: Twenty-five thirty-one?

Oleg: Yes. 

Salah: Twenty-five…

Wil: Thirty-one. 

Salah: Okay.

Oleg: Salah, you will like it. 

Vika: Twenty-five thirty-one.

Will: Not great but there is some water. 

Ashley: Twenty-five thirty-one?

Will: There is thirty-one thousand liters and 16% water loss. //So, like, a little…

Oleg: //Loss is ten for me. 

00:03:59:27

Will: Yeah. So, little. Little. 

Ashley: This one is very bad for me. Very. Very bad. 

Vika: Okay. 

Oleg: How? How?

Salah: For me it’s okay. 

Vika: Sorry. 

Oleg: Quiet. Quiet. 

Ashley: Very bad. Only sixty people can survive there, and we want five thousand. 

Vika: Ew.

Oleg: Ash…

Ashley: I’m just saying my…my point of view. 

00:04:31:19

Salah: [SL] Take.

Oleg: You don’t get such proposal every day.

Vika: Could you check, please…

Ashley: No.

Vika: //sixteen seven. 

Salah: //No. No. 

Vika: Sixteen seven.

Salah: Sorry. Huh?

Oleg: Sixteen seven, right? Well, if you are suggesting it, we probably…

Salah: Sixteen?

Vika: Seven.

Ashley: Oh!

Will: Which one?

00:04:59:23

Ashley: I really like this one. 

Vika: Sixteen seven. 

Ashley: It’s really good, but very-very many…

Oleg: [SL] Me too.

Ashley: It reaches high population. 

Will: 95% water loss. I can see now. There is a connection here. So, there is supposed to be a lot of water there. So, there is like two hundred and forty-five K liters, right? But the thing is that it’s got the water loss. Which means that it’s not sustainable in a long run. As far as I understand it. So…

Oleg: The water loss is very high unfortunately. 

00:05:30:04

Vika: Well, it’s the same as the last one.  

Oleg: It’s sixty-six here. It’s exceeded by six. 

Ashley: Have you ever found any points where they’re //kind of, like, about equal? Where, like the amount is, I guess…sorry, proportional to the amount that is being lost in…not proportional. Um…

Oleg: //Much more powerful filters are needed to…

Salah: Thirty-five eleven.

Will: Yeah, I’ve found…a lot of times there is points where it’s like…

Salah: Thirty-five //eleven.

Will: //in that zone. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

00:05:59:09

Ashley: Thirty-five twelve?

Salah: No. Thirty-five eleven.

Ashley: Oh. Eleven. 

Will: And then…

Ashley: I’m alright with it. 

Oleg: Okay. 

Vika: Yeah, for me too. 

Ashley: All comes down to one. 

Will: One second. I’m trying to…

Salah: What if they can change the role every time?

Ashley: Yeah, that would be nice. 

Salah: It would be more, yeah.

Ashley: Actually. 

Will: Okay, what’s the number?

Oleg: Okay. 

Ashley: Thirty-five eleven.

Will: Thirty-five eleven?

00:06:32:18

Will: No water. 

Ashley: Scratch that. 

Will: Ew, huh?

Vika: No water? In my isolation?

00:07:00:17

Ashley: What about thirty-five four?

Will: I don’t know! What about thirty-five four?

Salah: Thirty-five four?

Will: Let’s see here. 

Ashley: Four. 

Vika: Thirty-five what?

Oleg: Great. //I think you all will like twenty-four thirty-seven.

Will: //100% loss. 

Ashley: //100% loss? One more time.

Oleg: Twenty-four thirty-seven. You’ll like it for sure. 

Vika: But not exactly. I like thirty-five four. 

Will: [UI]

Oleg: No water?

Vika: There is no water there?

Salah: Twenty-four?

Vika: //But you…

Oleg: // Twenty-four thirty-seven.

Ashley: //It’s the worst for me.  

00:07:30:17

Ashley: The worst for me! 

Oleg: What’s wrong with you today?

Ashley: Why do you choose such points?

Will: Which one, Oleg?

Vika: //Why do you even exist?

Oleg: //Twenty-four thirty-seven.

Vika: Oh, thirty-seven. So, twenty-four…No. Twenty-four thirty-seven.

Will: It’s right on the borderline. But it works. 

Oleg: So, there is water. 

Vika: //It’s okay for me.

Salah: //Check thirty-five thirty. 

Will: One second.

Salah: Thirty-five thirty. 

00:08:04:24

Salah: [SL] Did you try?

Ashley: I’ll have one later, maybe. I don’t…

Vika: Thirty or thirteen? It’s okay for me. 

Will: Okay. What’s that one again, Salah?

Salah: Thirty-five thirty.

00:08:34:24

Will: That’s pretty good. That’s pretty good.

Ashley: Thirty-five thirty?

Will: That’s the best one so far. 

Vika: Twenty-two twenty-seven. 

Will: One second. 

Vika: Oleg, please check twenty-two twenty-seven. 

Oleg: Mhm. 

Ashley: Thirty-five thirty is not the best for me. 

Salah: For you it’s okay, uh? For you, Ash?

Ashley: It’s not really great, but…

00:08:59:00

Salah: What’s the reason? //The percentage for the loss?

Ashley: //Vika, what did you say?

Vika: //Twenty-two twenty-seven. 

Will: Forty-one percent, but it’s…it’s…

Ashley: I like it about as much as his. Which is “eh”. 

Oleg: Vika, the losses will be high.  

Salah: It’s normal. Even the depth. It’s not the best one.

Ashley: Yeah. 

Oleg: It is possible to clean it, but…

00:09:29:25

Ashley: What about…

Vika: No. 

Ashley: What about twenty-five five?

Will: Okay, I have to check. Vika, which was the one that you wanted?

Vika: Twenty-two twenty-seven. 

Will: Twenty-seven…Not bad at all. That might beat the other one just by a little bit. 

Salah: Great!

Vika: Cool. 

Ashley: I’m at “down” for both of those, but…

Vika: So, could you, please…

00:09:59:05

Will: Shut up!

Ashley: Repeat?

Vika: Shut up, please! 

Salah: What’s…

Vika: No, could you please repeat the point?

Ashley: I was suggesting twenty-five…

Vika: Twenty-five…

Ashley: Five. 

Vika: Five. Oh, wait. 

Oleg: No. 

Ashley: Are you being serious? Or are you just saying this because I didn’t like yours?

Oleg: Yes. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Vika: Um…

00:10:28:15

Vika: I think that it will be a big lose…big lose of water?

Ashley: The loss?

Will: //Which one?

Vika: //Loss. Loss of water. 

Ashley: Twenty-five five. 

Vika: The size of PCA is huge. 

Ashley: Hm…

Will: But it doesn’t matter because there is no water. 

Salah: I like the point that Vika said – twenty-two twenty-seven. 

Will: Twenty-two twenty-seven has the most water of anything.

Salah: Yeah, this one is good also for me. Vika – okay. Oleg…

00:10:59:09

Will: What do you mean it’s not good for you, Ash? What do you mean by that?

Ashley: What do you mean? 

Will: What do you mean? Explain yourself. 

Ashley: I’m a part of the Human Factors. So, I’m trying to see how our population can actually survive and thrive there. 

Vika: Ew!

Will: Let’s get to the point. What is this about?

Ashley: It’s about access…Location accessibility. As well as how much population can be supported by the amount that is there. And the number is //quite low for the population reached. 

Oleg: //Oh! Thirty-five forty-seven. 

Will: Alright. Thirty-five forty-seven?

Oleg: Mhm. There must be water there.  

00:11:34:00

Will: Not bad. 

Oleg: Thirty-five forty-seven.

Ashley: It’s a “no”! 

Vika: Well, not bad, by the way. 

Ashley: Thirty-five forty-seven. Okay. 

Oleg: So? What?

Ashley: Let me look…

Vika: Are they online? Not yet.

Ashley: Damn! Even worse! Why do you always choose such points?

Will: Why do you even exist?

Vika: In my isolation?

Oleg: //Yours doesn’t show correctly!
Will: //In my isolation. 

Ashley: Oh my God! The worst! The worst!

00:12:02:01

Will: The worst?

Ashley: Is that a word?

Will: Yes. 

Oleg: Set up a tent there.

Will: The worst. 

Ashley: The worst. 

Vika: The worst.

Ashley: Why aren’t our friends talking to us?

Oleg: They are sick of you. 

Ashley: So sad. 

00:12:38:06

Vika: Even sadder. 

Ashley: My lips are dry. 

Vika: Do you need…

Ashley: I have this, but it doesn’t help, really. //Vika, give me something else.

Vika: //Yeah, but…But efficiently I can use it for my eyes too. 

Will: Why not? What’s stopping you?

00:13:02:00

Vika: Oh…

Will: No, really. Maybe it works. Okay. 

Vika: Ew.

Ashley: Are you ready for our pictures //[UI] during the next task?

Will: //I’m gonna send them…I’m gonna send them twenty-two twenty-seven and thirty-five thirty.

Salah: Okay. 

Vika: Huh?

Ashley: What did you say?

Salah: Go ahead. Go ahead. 

Will: Twenty…twenty…

Vika: Twenty-two twenty-seven //and thirty-five thirty.

Salah: //[SL] Our points. 

00:13:31:19

Vika: Could you check, please, thirty-six thirty-two?

Oleg: Thirty-six forty-two?

Vika: Thirty. 

Oleg: Mhm…Again?

Ashley: You all choose such…

Oleg: You are the one to talk? 

Ashley: Your other point was better.

Oleg: She’ll say it now. It’s like you’re getting older. Worse and worse. 

00:14:01:04

Ashley: Aah! Grandma! I don’t like anything! 
Oleg: Can’t fucking please you. 

Will: Which number? Which one? The one we’re checking. 

Vika: Umm…

Will: Was it you?

Ashley: She wanted thirty-six thirty-two. 

Vika: Yes. 

Will: Thirty-six thirty-two. 95% loss. So, no.

00:14:30:17

Oleg: How about twenty-one sixteen? I just randomly picked it. It’s not great for me, but is there any pattern?

Vika: Absolutely not. The water is very dirty. And the losses are high because of high UCA. 

00:15:01:01

Will: Which number?

Oleg: Twenty-one sixteen. I’m just trying to find a pattern here. Whatever is good for me has no water. And the bad ones…

Will: No water. 

Oleg: Damn, this isn’t good either. 

Will: I think that…

Oleg: There is no pattern?

Will: I think they appear randomly.

Oleg: Mhm. 

Vika: Guys, eleven twenty-two. Please. 

Ashley: Hm…

00:15:31:12

Vika: What? What?

Will: Which one?

Vika: Eleven twenty-two. 

Oleg: So…

Will: The amount of water is so little that…Why…

Vika: No need to check?

Will: Why did you even ask me? I don’t know.

Ashley: Okay. But I have forty…

Vika: You’re so boring!

Ashley: [coughs]

Oleg: Go ahead! Say it! Forty…

00:16:00:00

Ashley: Forty six.

Will: Okay. One second. 

Oleg: Forty and six, yeah?

Ashley: Yeah.

Oleg: Terrible. Absolutely impossible.

Vika: It’s fine. 

Ashley: Oh! 

Oleg: Just incredible. 

Ashley: I’ve got one supporter for now. 

Oleg: Salah will tell you now that it’s too deep. 

Salah: Which one?

Ashley: Forty and six. 

00:16:31:16

Will: Okay. Which one?

Oleg: //At least thirty…

Ashley: //Forty six. 

Salah: //[UI]

Will: Forty.

Ashley: Mhm. 

Will: Six. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Oleg: At least 30% water loss. 

Salah: Normal. Normal. 

Ashley: Wow. 

Oleg: So, it isn’t too deep?

Ashley: It’s okay? //What about you?

Will: //Little…little water. 

Oleg: 30% loss.

Salah: Little.

Will: Little water.

Ashley: Very little?

Will: Very little.

Ashley: Hm. 

Salah: You sent already to them about the two points?

Will: Yeah. 

00:17:07:00

Ashley: By the way…

Oleg: No. 

Ashley: //Thirty-seven four.

Vika: //It’s a “no” 

Oleg: No. Absolutely not. 

Ashley: No?

Oleg: It’s murky. Seventy-three. 

00:17:30:10

Oleg: It’s…

Will: Which number?

Ashley: //Thirty-seven three.

Salah: //Maintenance specialist is not there? Maintenance.

Will: Thirty-seven four?

Ashley: Mhm. 

Oleg: Although…if there is water, it’s possible.

Will: There is enough water…

Ashley: Mmm. 

Will: To…

Oleg: So…Well, the loss is up to 60%.

Ashley: It’s…

Will: This is one of the ones you were talking about, Ash. Where it’s like on the borderline. 

00:18:00:19

Will: Like, is there balance? It’s enough water. 

Vika: Could you please repeat it?

Ashley: Thirty-seven four. 

Vika: Okay. Thirty-seven four. 

Ashley: Because that one would be really good for me. 

Oleg: Not bad but no. 

Ashley: Is it better than the other ones?

Vika: But it’s high…the contamination is high.  

Ashley: Hm. 

Vika: It’s fine in general, in case Oleg can filter it. 

Oleg: Well, we’ll have 60% loss.  

Vika: Well, it’s…

00:18:30:24

Vika: Let me check this one. 

Oleg:  Hm. Amazing. Fifty sixteen. I think everyone will like it. It’s like…

Ashley: Again?

Oleg: Fifty sixteen. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Vika: And twenty-seven forty-two.

Ashley: Okay. So, the one that Oleg suggested…hold on…

00:19:00:12

Oleg: Fifty sixteen.

Ashley: Not bad. 

Oleg: Oh, finally.

Will: Which one?

Oleg: Fifty sixteen. //10% loss.

Vika: //The water loss will be high for me. 

Will: Fifty sixteen?

Oleg: Mhm.

Will: No water. 

Oleg: Fuck.

Ashley: Okay. How about Vika’s?

Vika: Twenty-seven forty-two.

Will: Twenty-seven…

Vika: Forty-two. 

Ashley: Boo! 

Will: //100% water loss.

Ashley: //Absolutely not. 



00:19:31:27

Oleg: Damn! 

Ashley: Okay, so, we are…So, let’s say, it was… twenty-two twenty-seven that was pretty good?

Will: Twenty-two twenty-seven, thirty-five thirty. 

Ashley: And what about thirty-seven four?

Will: Thirty-seven four…That’s acceptable for me. 

Ashley: Mhm. I think everyone else said it was fine too. 

Vika: Which one? Which one?

Ashley: The thirty-seven four. 

Vika: Looking at the contamination, It’s not the best one. 

00:20:00:02

Vika: And what…Oleg, what did you say about thirty-seven four? Are you able to clean it?

Oleg: Thirty-seven four? I believe that one wasn’t not too bad.

Vika: No. The contamination //is high there. Very muddy.

Oleg: //Wait. Hold on.

Ashley: //I think you said 60%. 

Oleg: Oh, yeah. 60% water loss. 

Vika: Twenty-two twenty-seven is better for me. And we also had thirty-five thirty, right? Thirty-five thirty, Ash. 

Ashley: Yeah. That’s an option.

00:20:30:16

Ashley: It’s way worse for me, but…

Vika: And what did we say about twenty-four thirty-seven? It was at the beginning. 
Will: What are you talking about?! What? No, for real. I want to know. 

Vika: I want to know.

Ashley: Even worse.

Oleg: Twenty-four thirty-seven – 10% after filtration.

Vika: It’s bad for you, right?

Oleg: It’s always bad for her. 

Vika: What are you eating here?

00:21:02:00

Vika: Ew. Everything is so delicious. Where are our friends?

Oleg: NO Chicago today. They are on holiday break. Oh! There is something. 

Vika: 1st of May? Where? It’s us talking in the chat. 

Ashley: You said thirty-five thirty was the second good point, right?

Will: Yeah. You’re…wait, no. That’s Martian terrain. //Where do I get…oh, Martian meteorologist, okay. 

Oleg: //Ah, it’s me writing to myself. Nice. 

Will: This is you, right?

Ashley: Martian meteorology? Yeah?

Will: Yeah. Okay, cool. So, I’ll give you everything that I’ve got so far. 

00:21:34:15

Will: Has it come through?

Ashley: I think it comes through in three minutes.

Will: Even for us?

Ashley: Yeah, because they don’t…well, actually, maybe not. 
Will: I thought that ours was immediate. 

Ashley: Never mind. Ours was immediate. You’re right. 

Oleg: Look, we won’t even be able to finish the task without them.

Vika: No. 

Will: What?

Oleg: We won’t be able to finish the task without them. 

Will: Without them even. «Alright, thank you guys for existing. » 

00:22:02:00

Ashley: Oh, damn. 

Will: So, you can work with all of those. The ones that came out. …Huh?

Oleg: Will, did you ever see 0% water loss when you were checking the points?

00:22:33:09

Oleg: I mean, minimal volume. 

Will: Not really. There is always a certain amount. 

Oleg: So, there is no perfect state. 

Vika: But!

Will: There are quite a few. So…the past few times we were doing it, and there were, like, where there was a lot of water and minimal water loss.  

Ashley: Well seeing as we haven’t interacted with our Chicago team yet, can’t really uh…

00:22:59:24

Oleg: What? Any word from Chicago? None?

Ashley: Well, no. I’m just saying that there is no response. So, we’ll be waiting for them.  

Oleg: Yeah. Are you worried?
Ashley: Well, yeah. 

Vika: Are we not enough for you anymore?

Will: Thirty thirty-four. Check that one. 

Ashley:  I will in a sec. //Once these questions go away. 

Salah: //Who said?

Vika: I forget that //we have camera recording. 

Will: Struct geo. 

00:23:28:06 – 00:24:13:08

[no audio]

Oleg: Why are you screeching?

Vika: Thirty thirty-four. Structural geologist suggested it. 

Oleg: Oh, we’ve got messages, yeah?

Vika: Yeah. 

Will: That’s…that’s good. 

Ashley: //Thirty.

Salah: //Thirty?

Vika: It’s okay for me. 

Will: Thirty thirty-four. 

Vika: Oleg, are you able to clean //thirty thirty-four?

Oleg: //Hold on. Yes, hold on. Thirty thirty-four…

Ashley: It’s not real great for me. 



00:24:44:10

Salah: //It’s good. It’s good for me.

Will: //There is a lot of water. 

Oleg: So…there is…

Salah: Why are they not replying?

Ashley: I don’t know. 

Will: I mean, they are missing one person today. //I know that. 

Oleg: //30% at least.

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: There is a lot of water. 

00:25:11:03

Oleg: 30% water loss. 

Vika: It’s not too much.

Will: Yes.

Oleg: A lot of water, right?

Will: Yes. A lot.  

Oleg: That’s it. Great. Let me write it down. Thirty thirty-four. What did you think about it?

Ashley: Bad.

Oleg: Again? Bad again. 

Ashley: I don’t know why today is like this for me.  

Oleg: It’s your vibe. 



00:25:40:00

Ashley: I’m in a good mood today.  

Oleg: You’re hiding something. 

Ashley: [UI]

Oleg: I’m fine. Yeah?

Ashley: I’m fine. I’m fine.  

Vika: Write it down during the night depression.  

Oleg: Just like that. 

Ashley: I’m feeling good today. 

Vika: Get her out! Get her out! 

00:26:08:21 – 00:27:49:16

[no audio]

Oleg: Oh wow! All at once! Forty-seven eight, twenty-two twenty-seven, thirty-five thirty. 

00:28:19:18

Will: I told them that thirty thirty-four works. 

Salah: Yeah. They agreed, I think…

Will: Okay. 

Salah: On this point. 

Oleg: Oh, let’s do it. I like thirty thirty-four too. It’s the best one we’ve had. 

Ashley: They said they also looked at forty-seven eight. Did you guys get that?

Vika: Hm?

Ashley: Mechanical engineer said that they were also looking at forty-seven eight. 

00:28:54:09

Vika: Forty?

Ashley: Forty-seven eight. From the mechanical engineer. And thirty-five thirty. 

Vika: Thirty-five thirty was our point. 

Ashley: Was it ours? Okay. 

Vika: Mhm. 

Ashley: Oh, okay. Never mind. Forty-seven eight. 

Vika: Okay.

Will: Forty-seven eight – no water. 

Ashley: Okay. 

00:29:20:05 – 00:30:00:18 

[no audio]

Oleg: They are randomly spread out. 

Vika: That’s the trick. 

Oleg: There is no logical explanation. …And all the numbers are different. No pattern. 

00:30:42:03

Oleg: Earth. Earth. 

Ashley: What?

Oleg: Earth.

Ashley: No. 

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: It’s always [SL] not chosen for me. Everyone else has chosen. 

Oleg: You’ve always got the Earth. 

Ashley: Oh, paper [UI]

00:30:59:17 – 00:31:45:08

[no audio]

Vika: Four twenty is very dirty.  

00:31:52:20 – 00:34:19:09

[no audio]

Ashley: They are asking if we want to sign off on thirty thirty-four.

Vika: Yes.

Ashley: Let’s do it. 

Oleg: We’ve got to make a decision. 

00:34:39:27 - 00:34:56:14 

[no audio]

Will: Got ‘em. Mhm. MTS Sirius. 

Vika: Sirius [UI]

00:35:05:19 – 00:35:48:22

[no audio]

Vika: We are filling out already. 

Ashley: Hm. Oh. 

Will: What?

Ashley: They already have the…they already have the point in the signoff. 

Will: I put it in there. 

Ashley: Oh. 

Will: Like five minutes ago. 

Ashley: I didn’t realize that you could do that. Well then.

Will: You can do it too. 

00:36:22:22

Ashley: [UI]. One and two, say, that I put one there. One there…

Will: Oops. 

Vika: Yupi! 

00:36:44:06 – 00:37:25:17

[no audio]

Ashley: Do they know that we put our stuff in the signoff yet? Because now I just got another suggestion from them. I got…they asked about four twenty. 

Will: Yeah, I told them it’s thirty thirty-four. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Salah: So, they agreed on thirty thirty-four?

Vika: Mhm. 

Salah: I’m just waiting to sign off. 

00:37:55:15 

Salah: Who didn’t put? Vika…

Ashley: Although, I personally like four twenty a lot better. No, really.

Will: There is no water there. 

Vika: No for me. 

Ashley: Lame. Lame sauce. 
Salah: Hm. I think they agreed on thirty thirty-four. Because they are putting the information up. 

Will: Yeah. 

Vika: Ten minutes ago. 

Will: Um…

Oleg: So, what?

Will: Operations specialist says that they sent us videos. 

Ashley: What?

Will: Operations specialist says, they sent us videos about themselves. 

Ashley: Where is that?

Will: I don’t know. I’m gonna have to ask Reinhold.

00:38:29:25

Salah: What is it?

Ashley: Wait, like, they sent individual videos to us?

Will: They said, some kind of videos. 

Ashley: What?!

Vika: To us? Or…

Ashley: //I want to see it. 

Salah: //[UI]

Will: I have to ask them. I’ll have to see because we didn’t get any videos. 

Vika: Who?

Will: Operations specialist.

Vika: Oh, okay. 

Salah: Tell them to sign off, not to send videos. 

Will: No. He’s not sending videos. There was a video that they sent. Like, I sent them a video.

00:39:30:04

Salah: Yeah, okay. 

Vika: Yeah, right. 

Ashley: Looks like everything is signed off. 

00:39:45:23 – 00:40:11:23

[no audio]

Oleg: Who else is left?

00:40:30:15

Vika: So, I think that, maybe, we can start to…

Ashley: Mhm.

Will: Alright. 

Ashley: Are we missing anything?

Oleg: Everyone put their stuff in. 

Will: Let’s go. 

00:40:52:17 – 00:41:21:29

[no audio]

Vika: Yupi! 

Oleg: Did you forget it again?

Will: Fluid engineer reset for some reason. So, give them a minute. 

Salah: I read it as “flight engineer”. [UI] I was going to ask you why.

Oleg: Oh. Did you see the Name? Where “name” is, there is a monkey who covered her eyes.

Will: Mhm. 

Vika: Yes. 

00:41:58:28

Will: Where? What?

Ashley: Oh, yeah. 

Salah: Mechanical engineer.

Will: Oh! Yeah, boy! 

Vika: What time should we start the next?

Salah: At five. 

Vika: Oh. 

00:42:31:21

Salah: It’s the half time. 

Vika: In two hours?

Ashley: We can start earlier to get it done earlier, too. If we want. 

Vika: Can we? //I mean…will they…will…

Will: //We might not be. They might have someone check what’s going on. 

Vika: Will they…

Ashley: I don’t know. 

Will: Are they here observing?

Ashley: Oh. 

Vika: Huh?

Ashley: I don’t know.

Vika: They usually come from CPK for this task?

Oleg: For this one? No. 

Vika: Oh. Then we can. 

00:43:00:12

Vika: Oh…

Oleg: There is a grandpa. Well, not a grandpa? He is like…sixty years old.

Salah: We are waiting for maintenance specialist. 

Ashley: The Martian terrain guy said that maintenance isn’t here, and that he’s acting for that person, but…

Will: Okay. 

Ashley: Maybe he is…

Will: So, don’t choose. 

Salah: He forgot, you think?

00:43:31:07

Ashley: //Maybe.

Vika: //Now is…[UI]…Crispies. Ew. 

Oleg: Well, one more. 

Will: Ahhhh! 

Oleg: Done?

00:44:09:27

Will: Don’t tell us…Okay. 

Vika: //It’s fine. It’s fine.

Salah: //Why?!

Oleg: Damn. Finally. 

Salah: I’ll write them. 

Ashley: It’s been reset?

Vika: Reset. 

Oleg: Fuck. 

Vika: Fuck. 

Ashley: Again?

Oleg: He probably left. 

Salah: I’ll write to them: “What’s wrong with you?”

00:44:31:10

Will: It looks like it’s done now. 

Oleg: So? Is yours frozen too?

Vika: Yes. 

Ashley: Maybe.

Will: I think, this is what happens when it finishes. //This is what happened…

Ashley: //Oh, yeah. Because look, the maintenance thing was checked off if you look in the thing. I think it’s done. 

Vika: Okay, so. 

Oleg: Finally. 

Ashley: DeChurch nine. 

Oleg: Right away?

Ashley: Yeah. //As always.

Vika: //Really? Right away?

Ashley: As always. 

00:45:00:03

Will: Okay, let’s do this //as fast as possible.

Salah: //Are we done?

Ashley: For the first part. 

Oleg: That’s it? Let’s go?

Vika: Ew, ew, ew.  

00:45:14:18 – 00:45:41:08

[no audio]

Oleg: What? Are you looking for the camera that…

Ashley: I hear that too. 

Will: I think it’s the small one. 

Vika: Team hallucination. 

00:46:01:24 – 00:51:11:11

[no audio]

Vika: Well, fine! Fine! 

00:51:38:14

Oleg: How many sections are there?

Vika: Hm?

Oleg: How many sections?

Vika: What?

Oleg: How many sections? Two-three?

Vika: Two-three. 

Oleg: Two? …Two. Good answer. 

00:52:00:00

Vika: Clever balls. 

Oleg: Let me help you. I’m done already. 

Ashley: Don’t tell me. 

Vika: Well, he can. 

Oleg: I know the answers.

Ashley: You know, you are bothering me as usual. It’ll take more time. 

Vika: It’s all because of you, Oleg.

00:52:31:00

Oleg: I know the answers. I’ll tell you. 

Ashley: Fuck. 

Vika: We have a fun day tomorrow.  

Ashley: Mmm…

Vika: Mmm…

Oleg: [SL] REka. 

Vika: Oh, fuck! It is tomorrow. Motherfucker. 

Oleg: [UI]

Ashley: I would like to know how can we give saliva samples following the paradigm if we have [SL] RE?


00:53:01:10

Ashley: It has to be right after…right after you wake up. Then …fifteen minutes. Then thirty minutes and whatever…and we have [SL] RE.

Oleg: Well, we’ve done it already…

Ashley: No. 

Oleg: We have. 

Ashley: We haven’t because last time they…

Oleg: Not the last time. //The one before last. 

Vika: //It wasn’t last time. Yeah, yeah. 

Ashley: They made a mistake //that one time we didn’t …where we didn’t get our saliva samples so we didn’t do it on that same day. 

Oleg: //The one before last time. 

Will: Ew, huh?

Vika: I remember that it was once. At once? 

00:53:30:00

Vika: That…yeah, I remember that I did it. 

Ashley: Maybe for you, guys, but for us they changed it because we missed our saliva that day. 

Vika: Oh, yeah!

Ashley: Remember?

Vika: Right. Yes. 

Ashley: So, we did it on a different day. So, you guys…But how did you do that? We are in RE for twenty minutes. So, then you miss the first one and the second one?

Vika: Because…because RE was…how long?

Oleg: Twenty.

Vika: Twenty minutes. 

Oleg: Yes.

Vika: For twenty minutes. So, before that you’re doing your first samples.

Oleg: Yes.

00:54:00:14

Vika: And then, after RE you can…

Oleg: Wake up, get up. On your way to the bathroom, you get there and one more time. That’s it.

Vika: Yeah. 

Oleg: What do you mean? Yes! Yes, that’s how…

Vika: But it sucks. Yes. 

Ashley: It’s just another example of poor planning. Sorry. 

Oleg: Well, for sure.

Ashley: It’s another example of poor planning.  

Oleg: Absolutely. Do you think they don’t know? They don’t know what they plan. 

Vika: One hundred percent.

00:54:37:13

Vika: I have all of it tomorrow: urine, I’m on duty, RE, snot, saliva. Everything. Motherfucker. How does this happen? Blood. Everything. What a fun day.  

00:55:00:18 

Vika: Ew. 

Ashley: Oh, I didn’t mean to do that. Fuck. Must’ve done…

Will: Yeet!

00:55:33:29

Will: Psh-psh. 

Vika: Oh, no! 

Will: We’ll just talk to Reinhold because apparently, they sent videos introducing themselves. So…send them a video after this. 

Vika: Cool. …Did he send it…send it to you, // or to us?

Oleg: //[UI]

Ashley: Yes.

Will: //I guess they would’ve had to send it to NASA, so I don’t know. 

Oleg: //Well, no. Just…

Ashley://Fuck! 

Oleg: //[UI]

00:56:02:00

Will: I don’t know where their videos ended up. Maybe they decided not to pass them on for some reason, but.

Ashley: That’s fucking weird. Hmm.

Will: Or they got lost in the wash somewhere. 

Vika: [whispering] Fifty. 

00:56:26:24 – 00:57:07:07
