Transcript


Ashley: What’s with you? I simply didn’t hear.

Vika: Trusted. We trusted you. We depended on you.

Will: I have it.

Vika: Hello.

Ashley: Okay. Does everyone have it?

Vika: Yes. 

Ashley: [UI]. Okay, cool. And everyone is also recording a video, correct?

Will: Yes.

Oleg: Are you yourself recording it?

Ashley: Yes. I already…

Vika: What’s with the eyebrows?

Ashley: Don’t know. Okay. Everyone’s camera…You got your camera too.

Salah: Yes. 

Ashley: Okay. Um…Okay. 

00:00:32

Oleg: Start it. Start it already.

Ashley: Wait! Wait! Alright. 

Salah: [UI]

Ashley: Alright. 

Vika: Thank you tiger.

Ashley: //Ready?

Salah: //Welcome. 

Vika: Almost. 

Ashley: Today is June 14th, 2022. It’s mission day 222. The time is 2:27PM. Three, two, one, //mark!

All: //Mark!

00:01:03

Vika: Boy! Wow!

00:01:36

Vika: And will there be no structural geologist today?

Will: What?

Vika: Oh!

Will: I don’t know. Why not?

Oleg: He isn’t working.

Ashley: Can…

Vika: No. No.

Ashley: Can I have some paper, please?

Vika: Toilet…

Ashley: Thank you.

Vika: Do you need, tiger?

00:02:00

Salah: No, thank you. 

Vika: William?

Will: No!

Vika: Do you want some?

Oleg: No. [SL] I signed out.

Vika: Correct. [UI]

00:02:46

Salah: Are you ready, guys? Hm?

Vika: Of course. We can for…

Salah: Eleven sixteen.

Vika: Okay. 

Will: Eleven sixteen?

Salah: Mhm.

Ashley: Eleven sixteen.

Vika: Eleven sixteen. 

Will: Mine is arguing with me right now. 

Ashley: I like it. 

Salah: Huh?

Ashley: I like it.

Vika: No water. 

Ashley: Well then…

00:03:22

Will: Might have to do a little refresh.

Salah: No water?

Ashley: Mhm. 

Will: Is there water?

Vika: No.

Will: Oh. I don’t know. 

Oleg: Thirty-six fifty.

Salah: Why are you asking?

Will: What?

Ashley: Thirty-six fifty?

Oleg: Yes.

Will: Aww man.

Vika: Okay. Thirty-six fifty?

Oleg: Yes.

Vika: Sorry, there is no water. I love your role.

00:03:36

Will: You said, no water at eleven sixteen, right?

Vika: Yes. 

Ashley: And what is there at…

Salah: Who checked?

Will: She did. 

Salah: How come?

Will: Because we found out last week that she can check the water and she hasn’t been telling us this whole time. 

00:04:08

Salah: Really?

Will: She has the same capabilities as I do. Can you believe it?

Vika: Not the same.

Will: Not the same?

Vika: Almost.

Will: Almost, yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. // What do you think…

Salah: //Check from your side, okay? Just to double check.

Oleg: //Come on, tell us already.

Will: //We double checked. It’s the same. 

Ashley: Eleven forty-four.

Will: You.

Vika: No, you…There’s no water.

00:04:32

Oleg: Really dirty.

Ashley: Alright! Alright!

Vika: Yuck! Your water is so dirty!

Salah: We think that you are making some calculations and then you are telling us the [UI] and it’s //just the [UI]

Oleg: //[UI]

Will: Well, because…Because there is no water. I do say that there is no water a lot, but there is an additional calculation as to whether…if it does have some water, how much is actually there, because there is a percentage that we lose. 

Ashley: Two thirty-nine.

00:05:00

Ashley: What are you…

Vika: There is no water.

Will: Which one?

Vika: // Two thirty-nine. 

Ashley: // I said two thirty-nine.

Oleg: Dirty. 

Ashley: Well…I see you are all against me.

Vika: You are all dirty.

Ashley: What I like you never like. How can we live like this?

Oleg: Ash, you seem to be very active today.

Ashley: Me?

00:05:30

Vika: Easy, easy.

Ashley: Because I have chocolate. Of course.

Vika: Okay, hold on. 

Oleg: Yes. Chocolate is cool.

00:06:00

-

00:06:21

Oleg: All the spots today are somewhat…

Vika: Waterless.

Oleg: Well, not only waterless.

Ashley: What are you…

Oleg:// Come on, say it.

Vika: //Say it.

Ashley: Eighteen thirty-five.

Vika: Mm.

Ashley: Oh!

Will: Not bad. Not bad. Really really good. 

Ashley: This is revolutionary. 

Vika: //But it is very dirty.

Oleg: //Let me add.

Will: Yes, but there is so much water there that…

Oleg: But it is very dirty.

Ashley: But…

00:06:53

Vika: Very dirty...

Ashley: There is so much water…

Oleg: It is murky and there is 60% water loss.

Ashley: Fifty?

Oleg: Sixty.

Ashley: Well, we had worse.

Will: Yeah, but it’s like…Even with this one, it is a lot. So much water. An awful lot of water. 

Ashley: Perhaps, it is one of our options. 

Will: Yes. Oh, that’s for sure.

Ashley: What’s “options”, again, in Russian?

Will: Possibilities.

Ashley: Possibilities. Okay. 

00:07:24

Ashley: I said it is one of our options.

Will: Yes, even with this, there is more there…

00:08:09

Ashley: Please, look at this one too. Nine twenty-eight.

Vika: Twenty-seven twelve.

Vika: Nine.

Oleg: Nine… Now, that is a completely different story.

Vika: There’s water.

Ashley: Yes?

Vika: Yes.

00:08:34

Oleg: Yes. It’s a good one. Salya likes it too. The depth is not too great.

Ashley: Do you like nine twenty-eight?

Salah: Yeah.

Ashley: Nice.

Salah: Twenty-eight?

Ashley: Yeah. I said nine twenty-eight, correct?

Oleg: Yes. Nine twenty-eight. Have you forgotten what you just said?

Ashley: Well, I have already looked at Vika’s spot.

Vika: Twenty-seven twelve, yes. 

Ashley: // Twenty-seven twenty is not a good one for me.

Will: //Twenty what? Which one?

Vika: Twenty-seven twelve. It’s not a very good one?

Will: Twenty-seven?

Vika: Twenty-seven twelve. 


00:09:00

Will: Nineteen?

Ashley: Twelve.

Vika: Eighty-nine.

Will: Which one?

Vika: Twenty-seven twelve.

Ashley: Twenty-seven twelve.

Vika: Twelve. One and two.

Will: What kind of Moscow accent do you have? You have a regional accent. 

Vika: I have a Moscow area accent. 

Will: Yes, yes, yes. 

Ashley: But nine twenty-eight was okay for you?

Salah: Nine?

Ashley: //Nine twenty-eight was okay for you?

Will: 100% water loss.

Salah: Yes.

Vika:  //Twenty-seven twelve?

Will: //Yes.

Ashley: //Okay, so nine twenty-eight is also good for you.

Vika: //You’re making it up.

Will: //No.

Vika: //Oh, water loss. Okay. 

Oleg: //Nine twenty-eight is simply perfect.

Oleg: Twenty-seven twelve has 100% water loss. 

Ashley: What was…did nine twenty-eight look okay for you guys?

Will: I have not checked.

Ashley: Oh. 

00:09:30

Vika: Check it then.

Ashley: Shoot. What was the point that I told you earlier that was good. 

Vika: Nine twenty-eight and eighteen thirty-five.

Will: Yes, eighteen thirty-five. And what was the other one? It was…

Salah: Not nine twenty-five?

Ashley: Nine twenty-eight.

Will: Nine twenty-eight.

Vika: Now nine twenty-eight. 

Will: Nine twenty-eight is also very good. Nine twenty-eight also very good. 

Vika.: It’s better, actually, than previous point…The previous point.

 00:10:00

Oleg: Wait. Have we left eighteen thirty-five?

Salah://[UI] Now she is talking.

Vika: //Look at nine twenty-two. You’ve already looked.

Will: //Right? Right?

Oleg: Yes.

Will: That’s what I’m saying.

Salah: Yeah. 

Vika: What? Sorry, what did you say? Uh?

Ashley: They are just commenting on the fact that you had the ability to look at the water the whole time.

Vika: It happens.

Ashley: Okay. So what now?

00:10:30

Ashley: Eight thirty-five and nine twenty-eight.

Vika: Nine twenty-eight is better.

Ashley: Nine twenty-eight is better.

Will: It’s…the difference in water is…

Ashley: Similar?

Will: Minimal?

Ashley: Minimal? So, nine twenty-eight is our number one?

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: Was nine twenty-eight good for you too?

Oleg: Yes.

Vika: For me, nine twenty-eight is better.

Ashley: Okay. Even for me, it is better too.

Vika: Well, okay.

00:11:00

-
00:11:28

Ashley: Oops, I meant to send that to the human factors team, not to the geology team. Sorry, guys. 

Vika: No. 

Will: I don’t know. You did.

Ashley: Sorry. I really meant to send that to human factors. 

Will: “Please take a look at nine twenty-eight”?

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: You sent that to human factors and not to geology team.

Ashley: Oh, okay. Never mind.

Vika: [SL] What?

00:11:58

Ashley: Sedimentologist…I got excited for a second. Just like last time.

00:12:30

-

00:13:06

Vika: What? Hm?

Will: What?

Vika: What is it? Why are you laughing?

Will: What’s with you?

Vika: Come on, what is it with you? I am looking to see what is happening there.

00:13:44

Oleg: Have you found something else interesting?

Ashley: No, I’ve already continued [UI]

Will: //We just need…

Oleg: //Thirty sixteen. Thirty sixteen.

Will: We just need to wait while…

Ashley: Thirty sixteen…

Salah: Sixteen.

Oleg: [UI]

Ashley: Not the best one. The others are better for me.

Will: It’s not the best, but it is an option. 

Vika: Thirty sixteen?

00:14:15

Will: Yes.

Vika: It’s okay.

Oleg: Minimal expenses for cleaning. Practically clean water.

00:14:50

Ashley: Tell them that there are plums there.

Oleg: They are laxative, by the way.

Ashley: What? What?

Oleg: Laxative. 

Ashley: We need to have well-formed poop, you know?

Vika: Little pea-sized drops of poop on a little path.

00:15:21

Oleg: It’s not important for you anymore. You already…

Vika: Why?

Oleg: Because she’s already frozen her [SL] biowaste.

Vika: Does it need to be frozen?

Oleg: Yes.

Vika: Good that you clarified it for me. I was planning to heat it up.

Oleg: You are on the wrong side.

00:15:50

Vika: What is happening here?

Oleg: She made my side dirty.

Vika: With her hair?

Oleg: No. With the brown stuff. 

Vika: Yuck. She got mine dirty too. 

Oleg: With the brown stuff. 

Ashley: Brown what?

00:16:32

Oleg: Ash, why are you not writing? Previously, you used to write to them a lot.

Ashley: But they have not yet //contacted us.

Vika: //She is writing a lot now too. It’s just that no one is responding.

Oleg: So, are they tired of you?

Ashley: Perhaps, they are. It happens.

Vika: It happens. There’s nothing to be done.

Oleg: So, people get tired of you.

Ashley: Yes. I know that.

Vika: Seriously? No. Not at all…Alright, alright. 

00:17:04

Vika: I love this conversation.

Ashley: You will all miss it when the isolation ends. 

Vika: Miss the “departure”? 

Will: And can I…

Vika: No.

Will: What about our juice?

Vika: Oh, no, you can’t.

Will: Okay? No? Then give me some fruit drink. Quickly.

Vika: Take it. 

00:17:36

Vika: Which one do you want?

Will: Any one is fine.

Vika: We have some cranberry drink.

Will: Yes.

Vika: Is it okay?

Will: Yes. 

Vika: It’s somewhat sticky. 

Will: You are.

Vika: Well, yes. Today I am also…lethargic and sticky. Why so?

Will: So what?

00:18:01

Will: How’s your weekend there? Is everything alright? Wait, wait, wait…Got a response, goes like this: “Hey, it’s going to be a minute. Team is very sleepy.” So it seems that they are waking up there. Alright. That’s okay, fine. It happens. 

Oleg: What time is it for them? Is it six or seven in the morning?

Will: Maybe…I guess so…

00:18:30

Will: What is it? It’s eight hours?

Ashley: I think it’s eight hours, yeah. 

Will: Eight hours. So, that means…

Salah: Eight or nine?

Ashley: //For Chicago, let’s see. What are they? Central time? I’ll check right now. 

Will: //Six forty-five. 

Ashley: They are Central, right? If they are Central, it’s 6:45AM over there. So, it is 6:45 there now. 

Oleg: Are they at home, or are they still going? 

00:18:58

Ashley: I think they are at home now because the university…the academic year…the students are done with university by now. 

Oleg: There’s nothing interesting. 

00:19:36

Oleg: Look at forty-nine thirty-six. 

Vika: I have gone crazy.

Ashley: Forty-nine what?

Oleg: Forty-nine thirty-six.

Vika: Instead of clicking “Search”, I clicked “Log Out”.

Ashley: Oh, no!

Vika: Hi, it’s me.

Ashley: Very bad.

Oleg: It’s a plain.

Ashley: It’s very bad for me. I am just saying.

00:20:04

Oleg: Just saying. 

Ashley: Martian terrain is like: Having some technical issues on our end at the moment. Apparently…I didn’t know waking up was technical. No, it can be technical. 

Oleg: What is this?

Ashley: What’s up?

Oleg: Completely clean. Twenty-eight forty-three. 

Ashley: Twenty-eight?

Oleg: Twenty-eight forty-three. 

00:20:40

Ashley: It’s fifty-fifty for me. Not the worst and not the best. 

Oleg: So, it’s good then. 

Ashley: It’s not good. Just okay.

Vika: Yes, but there’s no water there. 

Ashley: Okay. So, it’s bad. 

Oleg: Yes. 

00:21:06

Oleg: Oh, also, I think thirteen thirty-seven. Today, the northern part is for some reason more…Vika, is there something there?

Vika: What? What?

Oleg: Thirteen thirty-seven.

Vika: Sorry, I didn’t hear you. 

00:21:36

Vika: Thirteen… There’s nothing.

Oleg: Darn. Well, okay…

Will: They are saying they like nine twenty-eight, but they are now considering…

Oleg: They like it?

Will: Yes. Part of the crew. And the other part of the crew is now evaluating it. 

00:22:02

Vika: If they like it, I suggest we sign it and move on to our favorite part. 

00:22:36

Oleg: It seems you are pouring it into a barrel. 

Will: Well, you know, if you begin doing it this way, you can’t get any more. You need to simply blow into there, like…There, get it! 

Vika: [UI]

Will: Yes, you!

00:23:00

-

00:23:30

-

00:23:58

Oleg: Look at ten ten.

Vika: You liked the data. I mean the number itself. 

Will: No. 

Vika: It happens. 

Ashley: What is happening here today?

Will: [UI]

Vika: By the way, I think nothing unusual is happening. 

Will: Yes.

Vika: As always, we are simply living here. 

00:24:33

Vika: Almost eight months.

Oleg: It’s the eighth month already.

Ashley: What were we thinking?

Oleg: No. It has been eight months since the observation. 

Vika: Perhaps, even longer then. 

Oleg: The observation was twenty days. It’s more than eight months now. 

Ashley: Yes. What were we thinking?

00:25:04

Salah: What did they say about nine...?

Will: Twenty-eight? They are still looking at it, but it seems like some liked it. But…

Vika: Yuck.

00:25:31

Vika: Can I? Oh!

Salah: What?

Vika: Yes, I can…thank you, guys. You are so kind. 

Ashley: Well, okay. 

Vika: So tasty. Thank you. 

00:26:10

Vika: Oh, it’s so interesting for you. 

Oleg: Are you visiting a dentist here?

Vika: So interested. 

Ashley: I had so much energy at first, but now…

Oleg: You can’t remain yourself? Is it beginning to depress you?

Ashley: Yes. 

00:26:47

Oleg: I am wondering – is there an ideal spot here?

Ashley: Yes. The one that I suggested.

Vika: It’s here…Well, alright! Alright! Why are you starting it?

Oleg: An ideal spot.

Vika: Will, you are wonderful today. Has anyone told you that?

Will: What?!

Oleg: Whoever is going to listen to the audio will be delighted. 

00:27:17

Oleg: They will say: What language are they communicating in?

Vika: The language of testing. 

Oleg: They have moved to a new level of interaction.

Will: It happens. 

Vika: Perfect… Don’t cry, don’t cry. 

Ashley: I’m just thinking that I forgot to wash my face again today.

Oleg: So, you didn’t wash your face?

Vika: Shame! Shame!

Ashley: No, I…There have been so many tasks today. Then it was very…then the glucose. I simply forgot because I was hungry. 

00:27:58

Vika: I too forget everything when I am hungry.

Oleg: Since you remembered that you were hungry you have not completely forgotten. 

Ashley: Well, if my stomach is making such noises, it means that I am hungry. 

Oleg: And where is your brain? In your stomach or in your head?

Ashley: It depends on the situation. 

Salah: They write to you they are missing the mechanical engineer. 

Ashley: Oh, great.

00:28:34

Vika: Yes, darn. Yes. 

Ashley: Oh, yeah. Operation specialist. 

00:29:17

Vika: It’s alright. It’s not all that bad. 

00:29:30

-

00:30:00

Oleg: Look also at twenty-seven twenty-four. It’s a perfect spot in all respects. 

Ashley: I can’t now because…Oh, no. There is also [UI]

Vika: One more time, Oleg, please.

Oleg: Twenty-seven twenty-four. 

00:30:35

Oleg: Clean water, just slightly mineralized. 

Vika: I like it. 

Oleg: Salya definitely likes it. 

Salah: Which one?

Oleg: I am not even asking you anymore. Everything is great for you. You have eight hundred and ten. Twenty-seven twenty-four. 

Ashley: Twenty-seven twenty-four. 

Oleg: Twenty-seven twenty-four. 

00:31:12

Will: High level of water loss. 

Ashley: That’s bad.

Oleg: What about you? Show me, what do you have?

Ashley: Something. 

Oleg: How much should it be?

Ashley: Over five thousand. And there’s nine hundred. So, it’s bad for me. 

Oleg: Wait. Does it mean that the wind there is weak or…?

Ashley: «For me» or «for mine»? 

Oleg: No, you have to explain to me…

Ashley: I want to know what’s correct.

Oleg: It is...Whatever. 

00:31:46

Ashley: Is it «for me» or « for mine»?

Oleg: Wait, a low number – that’s what it means. 

Ashley: It means that too few people can live there. It…

Oleg: Nine hundred people can live there. 

Ashley: They want five thousand to survive. I can bring you my book. Even I need that [UI]

Oleg: Bring it. 

Vika: To rub everyone’s nose in it. Boy?

00:32:17

Ashley: Oh, shoot. I got up from the arm chair-too quickly. From a chair, not an arm-chair.

00:32:35

Ashley: Less than four thousand five hundred. It’s the worst. Oops, sorry. 

00:33:00

00:33:30

00:34:00

00:34:30

00:35:00

00:35:30

-

00:36:00

-

00:36:46

Will: Don’t say that out loud. 

Ashley: What are you guys doing?

Will: Later, later. 

Ashley: Don’t write anything in the chat you don’t want them reading. 

Will: I don’t…I don’t…It’s not [UI]

00:37:20

Will: Oh, fuck.

00:38:00

-

00:38:30

-

00:39:13

Will: They are saying that nine twenty-eight is looking okay. 

Vika: Hm? Sorry?

Will: They are saying that nine twenty-eight is looking okay. 

Vika: Perfect.

00:40:00

-

00:40:36

Oleg: What interesting information do you have there?

Ashley: I don’t know.

Oleg: Hm? You don’t know?

00:41:02

Will: Okay. They are onboard. They are all adding their stuff. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. So, Sign Off time. And…what I want [UI]

Oleg: Did we leave nine twenty-eight?

Ashley: Yes. [UI]

00:41:30

-

00:42:08

Oleg: And who got so hungry there? ...Salya, was it you who cooked the shrimp?

Salah: What?

Oleg: Was the shrimp your work?

00:42:33

Will: Perfect. That’s the best name so far.

Oleg: The shrimps are yours.

00:43:06

Oleg: Ash, why haven’t you added anything?

Ashley: Salah wrote to me to say…That I shouldn’t [SL] send. [SL] I have nothing. Okay.

Salah: We need sushi.

Ashley: Yes.

Vika: Yes. 

Salah: Yes. 

00:43:33

Vika: Actually, it’s possible. We have rice…

Salah: We have rice, yeah. 

Vika: We have fish…Clever balls. 

Vika: Yes, we can do it. 

Will: I feel like that would taste so bad //that we won’t actually…

Ashley: //Don’t think about that. 

Salah: Like the caviar last time?

Will: What was the caviar? Oh, yeah, yeah. That we won’t actually want sushi when we get out. 

00:44:03

Vika: Not here. 

00:44:30

-

00:44:59

Vika: Are you okay?

Will: So, yeah. So, I guess, struct geo isn’t there, so…

Ashley: She let you down. 

Will: Yeah. But I don’t even know which struct geo that is because there are like two.

Ashley: It’s true.

Will: So, I don’t know if this is the same one.

00:45:37

Ashley: Alright, I’m just going to enter something in for my maintenance specialist. 

00:46:04

Vika: Code zero. 

Oleg: Ash.

Ashley: Yes.

Oleg: I can’t see where these…what group are you in? Where are you?

Ashley: I am in human factors, spacemen factors. 

Oleg: Ok. And what are you inserting here?

Ashley: I am [SL] doing reading. I see zones, routes here. Zone…the red zone means [SL] others are assigned to drilling.

00:46:49

Oleg: Do you have a ten-point evaluation scale?

Ashley: Say again.

Oleg: Ten-point evaluation scale?

Ashley: Ten…I don’t understand.

Oleg: Do you set these values up to ten or is it just an absolute value?

Ashley: Well…it means…it seems they didn’t explain that exactly, but since I…

Oleg: Holy crap!

Ashley: What? What?!

00:47:21

Ashley: What?

Oleg: [UI]

Ashley: What did I not see? …Okay, I want to screenshot…

Will: No, no, no. It’s been fixed…

Ashley: I want to screenshot that…

Will: Oh man.

Ashley: That’s alright. It’s still here. Oh, no! It went back! Damn it! …Oh, damn it!

00:48:00

-

00:48:30

Will: Okay, mechanical engineer, maintenance specialist…

Vika: What are you talking about?

Will: They don’t have…the either of them… “Just so you know, we still don’t have mechanical engineer or the maintenance specialist here.” Don’t choose mechanical engineer or maintenance specialist. 

Vika: Didn’t want to anyway. 

Salah: Who? They said who?

00:49:00

Ashley: Maintenance specialist. 

Salah: Maintenance, okay. 

Will: But they do have struct geo. 

00:49:30

-

00:50:00

-

00:50:34

Oleg: They are not filling it out there.

00:51:00

-

00:51:26

Oleg: So, you decided to put the entire set of smiley’s there. 

Will: They are doing draw. 

Vika: Is it Russian? No.

00:51:59

Vika: Wow!

Salah: Yes.

00:52:34

Oleg: What?!

Ashley: Okay. [UI]

Oleg: Read in Russian.

Ashley: Ok…ok…write…[SL]write?

00:53:00

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: What does it mean? …[SL] write? Oh!

Vika: I don’t think so. 

Will: I think it’s supposed to be specialist. 

Ashley: [UI]

Will: Goddamn it! 

00:53:29

Oleg: I have a feeling that //part of these guys have not joined in yet. 

Will: //Fuck!

Ashley: They said that they don’t have mechanical engineer and maintenance specialist today.

Oleg: Mechanical, yes. He is now…and there is no hydraulic technician either. 

Ashley: No hydraulic technician? It means…

Oleg: Well, he is not checking.

00:54:07

Ashley: [UI]

00:54:41

Will: So, no mechanical engineer and no maintenance specialist. 

Ashley: Yes. 

Will: Are we ready?

Oleg: So, are we going to…?

00:55:11

Salah: Should we sign off?

Will: I’m just clicking it now to see if they deny it if they are still working. 

Salah: I signed off.

Will: Did you need to add something for mechanical engineer?

Ashley: Me?

Will: Yeah. No?

Ashley: He’s not in my group.

Will: Ah, ok.

Ashley: But maintenance specialist I tried to, but I can’t, and I told them. 

Will: Okay. Let’s see if they deny me or if they agree. So, we’re seeing…

Ashley: At least all of us checking it off will be letting them know that we are ready.

00:55:44

Will: Yeah. 

Vika: [UI]

Will: [UI]

Vika: Okay, alright. Why are you starting it?

00:56:18

Will: Okay. Alright.

Salah: [UI]

Will: They don’t have pump info yet. Okay, cool. So, don’t hit it again yet. 

00:57:00

00:57:35

Oleg: How did they calculate…

Salah: Mechanical engineer is putting his information in. 

Ashley: They are putting it on their behalf probably. 

Will: Yeah.

Salah: Yeah, by fluid, I think. [UI]

Will: Mhm.

Oleg: The engineer is adding things now.

Salah: [UI]

00:58:00

Oleg: However, he is putting in some abstract numbers.

00:58:47

Will: Why did…did you click it again?

Salah: It’s one of the [UI] there. 

Will: Yeah, but we have to wait for them. We will see. Maybe they respond.

00:59:16

Will: Okay, terrain specialist agreed. 

Oleg: How long are we there for?

Will: What?

Vika: For eternity.

Ashley: We won’t [UI] have any sound.

00:59:47

Salah: Mechanical…

Oleg: Broken.

Salah: //Yeah, everyone signed, I think. 

Ashley: //They said…they promised that they will be giving me the continuation for the other one. 

Will: //Yeah, but they probably will have someone…

Salah: //Someone, like a delegation?

Oleg: /Yes, I saw, I heard.

Will: //Yeah, they can…

Salah: They can sign. 

Will: //Or they will send us a message. 

Oleg: Only I didn’t understand whether they gave it or not. 

Ashley: They didn’t. 

Salah: [SL] They signed.

Ashley: They had a month. They had time. Then I see it in the cyclogram and I tell them //[UI]

Salah: Small things take time. 

01:00:16

Ashley: Something happened. 

Oleg: Kirill, it seems, something…

Ashley: Yes, I thought Kirill would have responded to this sooner, but apparently he hasn’t.

Oleg: Well, perhaps, there is no spare device to study the problem. 

Vika: Perhaps, there is. 

Ashley: What?

Vika: Perhaps, there is. 

Ashley: Perhaps, there is. 

Oleg: The question then is why they have not solved the problem. 

01:00:47

Ashley: I even asked them to simply send it to us and find online the official…

Oleg: Manual?

Ashley: Manual, so that we could look at it here. They haven’t sent it. And I don’t want to try it many times myself because we won’t have too much distilled water left. 

01:01:20

Ashley: And I don’t want to lose it. 

Oleg: Yes. It’s also the last one, perhaps, it won’t have too much impact…

Ashley: Well, yes. 

Oleg: Most of it is there, and the rest they will do after they sign off.

Ashley: Yes. I think that it wouldn’t be…there wouldn’t be any difference. So, I think it’s not very important. 

01:01:51

Oleg: So, you have saved me some time, right?

Ashley: Yes. 

Oleg: [UI]. So what? Are we going to be waiting for the mechanic?

Ashley: Do we just start continuing?

Will: Maybe, they will tell us…I would have begun working on…

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: On the questionnaire?

Will: On the questionnaire while they are…

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: Because the questionnaire doesn’t depend on it.

Will: Yes, of course.

01:02:22

Oleg: Which one?

Vika: The ninth.

Salah: Nine.

Ashley: Nine.

Salah: Now I think they are done.

Vika: Yee!

01:07:59

Vika: Oops. 

Oleg: Do you want to escape?

Salah: [UI]

Oleg: Done? Finish? I only just got to the first section.

Vika: Boy!

Ashley: [UI]

01:08:38

Salah: Vika, you [SL] are done?

Vika: No.

Salah: Oh, okay. You want to //[SL] shoot this time.

Salah: Yeah, I have//[UI] after you, then [SL] mine put earlier.

01:09:10

Will: So, no mechanical and no maintenance.

01:09:51

Oleg: Project RED got stuck for you, didn’t it?

Will: What do you mean?

Vika: Mine was stuck throughout the entire session. 

Will: Well, if it shows everything white…

Oleg: Yes.

Will: It means that everyone has checked. 

Oleg: But mine didn’t even move for me to see. 

Salah: Yeah, they are done.

Will: Yeah. 

Oleg: Done?

Salah: Yeah. 

Will: They have finished. 

Oleg: Then I am closing everything. 

01:10:37

Oleg: There’s no mechanic, and who else wasn’t there?
 
Ashley: Maintenance.

Oleg: Mhm.

01:11:00

01:11:43

Salah: It’s already five.

Vika: Do you have a pen, guys?

Salah: What?

Vika: A pen. 

Salah: I think, there. 

Vika: Oh. Thank you. 

01:12:22

Oleg: Are you the only one left? [UI] quieter than anyone…Vika, who is on duty today?

Vika: What?

Oleg: Did you see who is on duty there today?

Vika: I saw it, but can’t remember. No, I do remember. It is…

01:12:51

Oleg: I saw Polina, and…

Ashley: Ksenia, yes?

Vika: Ksenia.

Oleg: Oh, Ksenia. 

Vika. Yes, but…No, Polina simply came to say a few words. And there was another guy there. I can’t remember who he was. 

Will: What did she say?

Vika: Who? Polina? She said that she didn’t see my questionnaires and she didn’t see the video.

01:13:23

Vika: By the way, I need to upload it. I keep uploading to PS4 and PS5. In my mind, they live on the second floor.

Will: Well, okay. 

Vika: Oh well. There’s nothing to be done. 

01:13:59

Oleg: Why are you sitting here?

Will: Okay! 

Salah: Chocolate?

Vika: Oh, la la!

Will: It’s starting. 

Salah: //[UI] 

Oleg: //[UI]. The big one is for you right away. [UI].

Ashley: It always tastes better when someone else is cooking. 

Vika: No. When you take it from someone else. 

01:14:31

Oleg: Is it a childhood problem? Your older sister took everything from you, and you are now taking everything from everyone around.

Vika: Confirmed.

01:15:09

Vika: [UI]…Where did I upload them to then?

01:15:58

Oleg: What is the “piping system”?

Ashley: //Piping?

Oleg: //Piping.

Will: //Piping – it is the sewage system. Pipes…What?

Vika: No, nothing.

Vika: Pee pee, poo poo. 

Oleg: I have forty-two messages.

Will: Can you be quieter please? Like a normal person.

Vika: Sorry, no…How will you be able to live outside?

Will: Easily and quickly.

Vika: “Quickly” is the key word.

01:24:30

01:24:50

Ashley: Don’t worry. There’s only eighteen days left. 

Oleg: And what if it doesn’t work?
