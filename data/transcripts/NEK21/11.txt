00:03:52:07 – 00:03:59:28

[no audio]

Will: It’s alright. 

Vika: It’s a high level of…

Salah: Contamination?

Vika: Contamination, yeah. 

Ashley: How about twenty-one forty-eight?

00:04:16:14 – 00:04:38:05

[no audio]

Vika: Not bad for me. 

Ashley: Okay. Okay. 

Salah: Deep.

Ashley: Too deep?

Salah: Not “too”, but deep. 

Ashley: Deep, but not the worst. Okay, okay. Twenty-one forty-eight. What do you say?

Oleg: It may work, yes, but it is too deep.

Will: One second. I’m still working on the…

Ashley: Will’s make or break here. 

Will: Yeah. …Okay, what’s the number, again?

Ashley: Twenty-one forty-eight. 

00:05:30:21

Will: Not bad. Functional.

Ashley: Wow! Everybody says that it is not bad. Okay. It’s very good for me, so…

Oleg: Well, then forty-five thirty. It’s practically all the same parameters. 

Ashley: Forty-five thirty. 



00:06:00:09

Oleg: Same depth, only…

Ashley: It’s worse for me, but very…

Oleg: Worse?

Vika: It’s better for me. 

Ashley: A bit worse, but… I want to know how much water there is there.

Vika: For me it’s better. 

Salah: Very good for me. 

Ashley: Is there water there?

Will: Which one?

Ashley: Forty-five thirty.

00:06:30:25

Vika: Is there water there?

Will: No. 

Ashley: So my suggestions are better than Oleg’s. 

Oleg: I am only for it. What? Do you think I…

Will: So, eleven thirty-seven…

Ashley: And twenty-one thirty-eight.

Will: What was eleven thirty-seven? Who said “okay” on eleven thirty-seven?

Salah: I said. 

Will: Okay. You said “okay”?

Ashley: I said, it was alright, yeah. 

00:07:00:09

Salah: You?

Will: Oleg, you too? Eleven thirty-seven?

Oleg: Eleven thirty-seven? Hold on. 

Vika: Thirty-one thirty-one. 

Ashley: Maybe. 

00:07:30:05

Vika: Thirty-one thirty-one

Salah: Okay. 

Vika: Will?

Ashley: Eleven thirty-seven…

Will: Eleven thirty-seven doesn’t work?

Oleg: It works, but too much loss.

Ashley: Is twenty-one forty-eight better?

Oleg: Of course. 

Will: So…

Oleg: Are you happy?

Ashley: Very much. Very much. 

Vika: Can you check, please?

Will: Hold on. 

Vika: Okay. 

Oleg: Are you waiting till it gets purified?

00:08:00:06

Ashley: Yes.  

Will: Thirty-one thirty-one… No water.

Ashley: Okay, I will take how much [UI], so that you don’t need to work alone. 

Vika: Then thirty-six twenty-six. 

Salah: How about thirty-one thirty-one?

Vika: Thirty-six twenty-six

00:08:32:23

Will: Okay, which one?

Vika: Hm?

Will: Which one do you want?

Vika: Thirty-six twenty-six.

Ashley: Worse for me. Maybe, but it’s worse.

Salah: Very good for me.

Oleg: But yours is better, yes?

Will: Thirty-six twenty-six? Not important. No water.

Ashley: Okay, no. Nice. 

Salah: For Vika there is water. 

Will: Huh?

Salah: For Vika there is water. 

Will: Find some. 

00:08:59:11 – 00:09:20:29
[no audio]

Ashley: What about…

Oleg: //Still better?

Vika: //Yes. 

Ashley: Fourteen

Vika: Yes.

Ashley: Forty-nine

Vika: Yes. 

Ashley: Fourteen forty-nine.

Oleg: Today you seem…

Will: Fourteen?

Ashley: Fourteen.

Will: Fourteen.

Ashley: Forty-nine. 

Will: Forty-nine. 

Oleg: Why are you working so hard today, Ash?

Will: Almost no water. 

Oleg: Shoot!

Ashley: Okay, okay!

Vika: High contamination. 



00:09:51:07

Ashley: Okay, okay! I understand! 

Oleg: That’s it, you have twenty-one forty-eight. That’s it, you can just sit here.

00:09:58:06 – 00:10:42:27

[no audio]

Ashley: Easy! Nineteen fifty. 

Oleg: You are tireless. 

Ashley: What?

Oleg: Tireless. 

Vika: Too active. 

Ashley: To act.

Vika: Too active.  

Ashley: Too active?

Vika: Yeah. He said. 

Oleg: Well, so…

Vika: It’s okay. That’s good for me. 

00:11:20:12

Ashley: Oh! Okay, okay. 

Oleg: It’s better than twenty-one forty-eight. 

Ashley: Really? Wow! 

Vika: To be honest.

Ashley: Okay. Will?

Vika: What about you?

Will: What?

Salah: Which number?

Ashley: Nineteen fifty. 

Oleg: These are more delicious. 

Will: No.

Ashley: No? Well, then…

00:11:54:13

Ashley: Should we suggest twenty-one forty-eight to them?

Will: I already suggested that. 

Ashley: Alright. Let me tell my team. They are looking at forty forty-two. 

Salah: Check twenty-three fourteen.

Vika: Just a sec. Forty…

Ashley: Yeah, let’s check the one they suggested first.

00:12:30:05

Oleg: Not bad either, but why is it so deep?

Will: No, it’s 100% water loss there. 

Ashley: In forty forty-two? 

Will: Mhm.

Oleg: Yes, that is, we are looking, //where the depth is a thousand, and here it’s two thousand three hundred.

Salah: //Which one is the highest with water?

Will: In terms of water output?

Salah: Yeah, between all the points. 

Will: Right now, eleven thirty-seven. 

Vika: Hey tiger, what did you say?

Salah: Twenty-three fourteen. 

Vika: Twenty-three…

00:13:00:10

Salah: Ask them also about eleven thirty-seven.

Will: I already did. 

Ashley: What did they say about it?

Will: They haven’t said anything about it yet. 

Ashley: And we said that that one was second best, right? For us overall. 

Will: It’s…I mean, there is more water there available, but it’s, like, not everybody agreed on it. So, that was four out of five and that was five out of five for us. 

Vika: So, twenty-three fourteen is //not that bad…

Will: //Fourteen twenty-eight is looking decent. 

00:13:32:05

Ashley: Which one?

Will: Fourteen twenty-eight. 

Ashley: Fourteen twenty-eight?

Will: Mhhm.

Ashley: That’s what they suggested?

Will: Yeah.

Ashley: Not really great for me, but alright. 

Vika: Oh, it’s …high level of contaminations. 

Salah: It’s good for me. 

00:14:02:25

Will: There is…//it’s the most water. 

Salah: //Depth is only seven hundred. 

Vika: Oleg, please look at fourteen twenty-eight. …In terms of filtration. 

Will: It’s good for you…

Salah: Yeah. 

Will: Yours is passing but not great?

Ashley: Mhm. 

Will: Okay. 

Salah: You?

Will: For me it’s fine. 

Vika: High level of contamination.

Will: It’s not okay for you. 

00:14:30:28

Salah: For Oleg?

Oleg: In principle, it’s okay, but it’s deep. 

Will: Mhm. Two thousand three hundred.

Salah: Mhm. 

Oleg: I think there will be great costs for development.

Salah: They said to try forty forty-two. 

Ashley: //Yeah, we already …we did check that one. 

Will: //We checked that.

Salah: We checked? 

Oleg: In fact, there are no problems. But it’s too high to lift.

00:14:58:07 – 00:15:36:09

[no audio]

Vika: Be careful, please. You know, actually, it’s the same taste as…

Salah: Yeah.

Vika: Yeah. 

Vika: As another nuts. …Six twelve.

00:16:03:10

Ashley: Six twelve. 

Will: 100% water loss. 

Vika: It’s always like that. 

00:16:19:23 – 00:16:45:27

[no audio]

Ashley: What about…

Oleg: Is it really…

Vika: No.

Ashley: Thirty-one forty-one. Thirty-one forty-one. 

Oleg: Why is it all frozen for you?

Will: Forty-one forty-one?

Vika: // Thirty-one forty-one.

Ashley: //Thirty-one forty-one. 

Will: Thirty-one. 

Vika: It’s …

Will: A quick no. 

Vika: That’s good for me. 

00:17:15:23

Will: Yes. Because there’s no water. 

Vika: Okay. 

Salah: Deep for me. 

Vika: [SL] Advice.

00:17:29:06 – 00:17:57:24

[no audio]

Ashley: You said that there is 100% water loss at forty forty-two, right?

Will: Yeah. I let them know. 

Oleg: //And what about one forty-nine?

Ashley: //Because they keep saying. 

Will: One forty-nine. …No water. 

00:18:13:21 – 00:18:29:01

[no audio]

Ashley: Did you guys look at twenty-one thirty-eight? Because that seems to be what they keep looking at. 

Vika: Forty-eight?

Ashley: Twenty-one thirty-eight they seem to keep looking at for some reason. 

Will: Yeah, they are talking about it for some reasons because we told them.

Ashley: No, we told them twenty-one forty-eight. 

Vika: Yeah, forty. 

Ashley: Did you tell them the wrong point?

Will: What do you mean?

Vika: Boo!

Ashley: The one that we discussed was twenty-one forty-eight.

Will: Oh, shit! 

Ashley: Will!!

Will: No, twenty-one forty-eight is good. That’s…I guess I just fucking wrote the wrong one. 

00:18:58:26

Ashley: Will!! //Twenty-one forty-eight is my good point!

Will: //I’m sorry. Twenty-one forty-eight. It is a good point. Twenty-one forty-eight is good, but that’s just not the one…

Vika: So, thirty-eight, yeah? Right? Twenty-one thirty-eight. Right?

Ashley: Twenty-one forty-eight is the one that we like. 

Vika: Yes. But now…

Ashley: But they are now looking at thirty-eight. 

Vika: Boo! Oh, no…twenty-one thirty-eight is…

00:19:29:21

Ashley: Yeah, so it has to be forty-eight. 

Vika: Yes. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: Find some indirect sign of the presence of water. There is no logic at all. It seems that each point is absolutely autonomous.

Vika: Exactly. 

Oleg: Mm.

Vika: Maybe, Oleg. 

Oleg: I can’t imagine that everything could be so good there.

00:20:04:09

Vika: God, I want to sleep so much.

Oleg: There. Here’s this one – three forty-five. I know right away that Salah will like it.

Salah: Yes. 

Vika: You have some connection there.

Ashley: Say again. 

Oleg: Three forty-five. 

Ashley: Three forty-five. 

00:20:30:12

Vika: What?

Ashley: Where is it?

Vika: That’s not //bad, but the…

Ashley: //Not bad, not bad. Not bad.

Oleg: And that’s great, say it!

Ashley: Not bad.

Vika: Can you filter it?

Oleg: Yes. 

Vika: I agree. Will?
 
Oleg: It is completely in one filter mostly.

Will: Hold on. 

Salah: Very good for me. 

Oleg: The most important thing is to have water there. 

Will: In fact, twenty-one thirty-eight – it’s not bad…

00:21:00:03

Oleg: Forty.

Ashley: She said no. 

Vika: Definitely not. 

Will: Yes, but it’s one person. What do you mean “definitely not”?

Vika: It’s 100% contamination there.

Will: Oh, well okay. Well, okay. 

Oleg: Well, okay, okay.

Vika: Okay.

Salah: Wear a mask.

Will: Easy. 

Vika: Easy. 

Oleg: Will, //you never said anything about thirty-one forty-one.

Ashley: //It’s contamination of the water. 

Will: Hold on.

Ashley: Forty-one forty-one?

Vika: Thirty-one forty-one.

Ashley: Oh, thirty…

Vika: //[UI]

Oleg: //You said it’s excellent. 

00:21:30:06

Oleg: You are for it.

Ashley: Oops.

Oleg: It’s better than twenty-one forty-eight. 

Will: They say they simply love twenty-one forty-eight.

Vika: Hooray! Weee!

Ashley: That’s my point. 

Oleg: Write that it is “my point!” 

Vika: By the way…Oh, no, in general…Well, okay. 

00:22:01:07

Vika: So now what? Let’s finish?

Oleg: And we are sure there’s nothing at twenty-one forty-one, yes? 

Will: Hold on. Thirty-one forty…

Oleg: One.

Salah: What about the point that Oleg said – three forty-five?

Will: It doesn’t allow me to create for some reason.

Ashley: Thirty-one forty-one – it’s great! 

Vika: Let’s decide on twenty-one forty-eight. 

Will: One more time. Thirty-one forty-one? No water. 

00:22:30:19

Oleg: Oh, shoot, wait. This…//where is this point?

Salah: //What about three forty-five?

Will: Three forty-five, I mean…I don’t know, y’all, we’re kind of…

Salah: Three

Will: Forty-five. 

Oleg: Oh, sorry. I told you three forty-five. Three forty-five.

Will: Okay. They are saying that they are ready for twenty-one forty-eight.

Oleg: Excellent. //I am for it!

Vika: //Cool. 

Ashley: I am for it!

Oleg: Well, it’s from Ash. 

00:22:50:03 – 00:23:04:29

[no audio]

Ashley: Parts source, parts source.

Vika: Alright.

Ashley: Okay. So, I need to make some decisions here. 

Oleg: Okay. 

Ashley: Okay, so, [UI] 



00:23:22:19 – 00:23:48:16

[no audio]

Oleg: So, shall we complete Sign off? And that’s it, all done. 

Vika: I am ready, but nobody has completed anything yet. //And already…we can already.

Salah: //On which point they agreed?

Ashley: Twenty-one forty-eight. 

Vika: Yes. 

00:24:03:15 - 00:26:00:14

[no audio]

Oleg: Does anyone see the logic of the relief and the presence of water?

Vika: Do you see a gopher? But it’s there.

Oleg: Yes. 

00:26:22:20 – 00:26:53:00

[no audio]

Oleg: Ash, you are putting yours one after another, right?

Ashley: What?

Oleg: Are you putting them all there?

Ashley: These are some, and now I am [UI] doing. 

00:27:04:19 – 00:27:37:11

[no audio]

Will: They say they are ready…

Oleg: Twenty-one forty-eight?

Will: Yes. If you are ready now.

Oleg: We are ready. 

Vika: Yes, this text doesn’t seem to end for me. Oh, there, the end. 

Oleg: Done. Sign off. 

Vika: I think that’s not it yet. Material specialist, operation specialist. 

00:28:04:18 

Vika: Not everyone has completed. 

Will: Is it everything?

Salah: Yep. I’ll put it and then sign off. 

Will: Let’s go.

Vika: It’s not everything yet.

Salah: Yeah, yeah. We started. 

Will: Have you written everything?

Ashley: Wait, I didn’t put my values in yet. 

Will: Oh, then…I asked three times: Is everyone done?

Vika: I told you three times that not yet…

Will: You said it one time. 

Oleg: Hold on, wait.

Will: Exactly when I was doing it. 

00:28:32:15 – 00:28:55:05

[no audio]

Oleg: Done?

Ashley: No.

Oleg: No?

Ashley: Here we need to put in what I want.

Vika: No! Which one is your favorite?

Ashley: Oh my God!

Will: Don’t know. 

Vika: A great answer. 

Ashley: Four, six, five, six, four, six

00:29:31:16

Oleg: Will, what is your parameter…material…material LHSB – what is it?

Will: This, where there is water. It can sit in some kind of basin...

Vika: There are several levels of water. There are superficial layers and there are deep ones. Pools. Different pools: surface and deep. What matters is the distance between them, the distance between...

00:30:03:04

Vika: Like one pool…

Ashley: Alright. I’m ready now. 

Vika: Depth, distance between them.

Will: Hit that LIKE button. 

Salah: Yep. Signed off. 

Ashley: //Do you guys see mine?

Salah: //It was quickly, yeah?

00:30:30:15

Vika: Yeah. Only forty minutes. 

Oleg: It is okay right here. 

Vika: Can I live a normal life?

Oleg: Ash, it was sitting alright here. What’s the matter?

Ashley: Mine is showing that I clicked or not? …Because I clicked.

00:31:01:02

Vika: No, I can’t see.

Ashley: Once again. Done. And now?

Vika: Yes. 

Ashley: Cool. 

Will: Okay. I don’t see yours, Salah. 

Salah: They cancelled it. I don’t know why. 

Ashley: I see yours now.

00:31:38:00

Salah: Next task only twenty minutes, I think. Or we have…

Will: Yeah. Twenty minutes, and then to the surveys. But, I mean, this might be our record. 

Oleg: I’ll give it back. I will give it back now, don’t worry…See? You have it, too. 

Ashley: Same. Come on, maintenance specialist.

00:32:03:19

Oleg: Well, so what? Who hasn’t yet…

Ashley: Maintenance from my team. 

Vika: As I understand it, we need to do the ninth questionnaire?

Oleg: It is after that. Or do you want to do it now?

Vika: We have some gap.

00:32:30:07

Ashley: Yes, DeChurch nine after that. 

Vika: Immediately after that.

Oleg: Okay. Let’s start. 

Ashley: Well, why hasn’t somebody there…

Vika: One person?

Oleg: It’s your person. Go talk to him. 

Ashley: He is there now.

Oleg: Oh, there. The team….

Salah: Done!

Oleg: Why is he dragging his feet?

Oleg: And how did I do it incorrectly? What are you saying? 

Ashley: First you…Yes, Martian meteorology specialist.

Oleg: See how I helped you just right?

00:43:45:14

Ashley: Fluid engineer …[UI]

Oleg: Next. 

Ashley: Well, I can still think if I want to. 

00:44:16:19

Oleg: Ready? Well, let’s go. 

Salah: Ninety-one. 

Oleg: Next.

Salah: [UI]

Vika: How? Where next? Nowhere for now.

Ashley: Yes, go. Go now. 

Vika: Can you? [UI]

Ashley: [UI]

Vika: Oh, were we waiting only for you?

Oleg: Mine wasn’t showing that…

Vika: Hello! 

Oleg: I was thinking…Well, okay. I already sent the first letters. 

00:44:48:19

Oleg: And you are not saying to me. I am helping you, and you are not helping me.

Ashley: //Sorry! 

Will: //Give me some meat! Give me some meat!

Vika: //Why do you need so much?

Oleg: //I to you…

Ashley: I thought you have already done that.

Oleg: No. Well, why would I do it early? …I understand that it may be…So, please [UI].

Will: I wonder, they will probably be watching this video later and thinking: what happened to them? At least to the sedimentologist.

Oleg: Missing the nature. 

Will: We need to make strange noises. 

Ashley: They’ll be like, “Why does he always say ‘Ech!’”.

Oleg: Did you get infected too?

Ashley: Be like, does he have, like…Does he have Tourette’s?  Tourette’s //no, it’s just funny. 

Will: //It seems, yes. It seems, yes. 

00:55:48:26

Ashley: They will probably say: why do they always make such strange noises? They have something [UI].

Oleg: They will conclude that isolation affects audio messages.

Vika: Pee pee, poo poo.

00:58:11:12 – 00:58:28:20

Oleg: What?! Why are you looking at me like this? Did you get any letters?

Ashley: Nope.

Oleg: Huh?

Ashley: Yes, yes, yes, yes. 

Oleg: Yes. 

Vika: What?

Oleg: You said it yourself that nobody is writing to you. …You said that…

Ashley: I don’t want letters like the letters you get.

Vika: Boo!
