Translation




Saleh: [UI]

Oleg: Got it.

Ashley: And don’t minimize…Don’t minimize it. 

Oleg: Mhm. 

Ashley: Don’t minimize it.

Katya: Oh, oh, oh. I have no space. Hold on, just a second. 

Vika: Oopie. 

Will: What do you mean, you have no space?

Vika: And I can delete the previous recording, by the way, right?

Ashley: Continue recording you mean? 

Vika: I mean, yeah, recording. 

Ashley: You continue. 

Vika: The previous, I mean. 

Ashley: Oh, you can get rid of it, yeah, if it’s on…Yeah. 

00:00:30:06

Ashley: But, I mean, it on your thing anyway.

Katya: I’ll delete it now.

Ashley: Okay. So, everyone starts their video…their audio recording too. 

Vika: Yep. 

Ashley: Okay… Okay. So, again, just like last time, you know, when I count to three, we all say “Mark”. 

Vika: Okay. 

Oleg: Do you have the recording? 

Ashley: Yes. I have the recording. 

Oleg: Alright. We got it.

Ashley: Okay. So, everybody has their cameras turned on and your audio device turned on.

00:01:02:00

Ashley: Correct? 

Will: Is your audio on? 

Oleg: [SL] Correct. 

Ashley: Press the…

Saleh: Which one, this? 

Ashley: //Yeah. 

Will: //Yeah. Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. So, everybody should have a red dot. Yes. Okay. So…

Saleh: Video also? 

Ashley: Yes. 

Oleg: The sixteenth. The sixteenth. 

Ashley: And make sure it kind of…Yeah, make sure your face is fully into it. Yeah. 

00:01:30:10

Oleg: The sixteenth.

Ashley: Okay. Okay. So, today is November 16th, 2021. The time is 15:27. It’s mission day twelve. On a count of three: one, two, three. //Mark. 

All: //Mark. 

Ashley: Okay. So, at this point we can begin to establish connection with Martian analysis group. So, we can write to them on the chat. 

00:02:01:01 – 00:04:13:13

[no audio]

Will: What’s happened? 

00:04:16:20 – 00:06:41:27

[no audio]

Oleg: Are they already communicating with us or not? Or…

Will: I haven’t heard anything yet. 

Vika: [UI] …Oops, oops, oops. Please, forgive me.
Saleh: What is it?

Ashley: He’s asking if we’ve received anything from the Chicago team. 

00:07:11:05

Vika: Guys…

Ashley: Mhm. 

Vika: The point number thirty-one four. 

Katya: Thirty-one four?

Vika: Yes. What do you think? 

Saleh: Which point? 

Vika: Thirty-one four.

00:07:45:22

Katya: You haven’t looked yet? 

Vika: We have.

Katya: It doesn’t work, right? 

Vika: It works for me. 

Katya: Is it okay for you? 

Vika: Mhm. 

Katya: Perhaps, thirty-two fifteen works for everyone. 

Oleg: Just keep it as an extra point.

Katya: Well, okay. 

00:08:04:14

Katya: Oh…

Will: Did you say “thirty”, what?	

Vika: Thirty-one four. 

Katya: The depth is great. 

Vika: That’s just wonderful. There’s a lot of water. 

Katya: Well, yes, but we will drill it…

Oleg: Thirty-one four? 

Vika: Yes.

Katya: It’s twice as deep as... the previous point. //Twice as expensive.

Oleg: //Four or fourteen? Vika, is it four or fourteen?

Vika: Four. 

00:08:31:29

Vika: No. 

Katya: Murky.

Oleg: Too murky. 

Katya: Mhm.

Vika: Only forty-four percent. But the rest...there are no impurities at all.

Ashley: But there…it says here that only fifty population is possible.

Oleg: There’s a lot of depth there. 

Ashley: So it wouldn’t be that way for a lot of people. Population reached. 

Vika: [UI]

Katya: That’s for her.

Ashley: For her. 

Vika: Oh. 

00:08:59:20

Oleg: There. And the depth is great. 

Vika: The depth is great – it means a lot of water and, therefore, there will be enough for more people.

Vika: Do you have a lot of people there [UI]? In that same place, if there’s more than necessary, then it’s just [SL] use.

Oleg: So, cloudy impurities…cloudy impurities [UI]

Katya: Saleh, what do you think about thirty-two fifteen point? 

00:09:31:00

Vika: [UI]

Saleh: Hm…[UI]

Ashley: It’s not bad for me. 

Oleg: It’s…

Katya: Not bad? 

Ashley: Not bad. 

Oleg: I…

Will: Which one? 

Katya: Thirty-two fifteen. Thirty-two fifteen. 

Vika: [UI]

Katya: For me is not bad either, just, if it’s for everyone…

Oleg: It’s great for me. For me, just one filter can tackle it. 

00:10:03:05

Will: Okay. 

Oleg: Yes, it’s…It’s just…

Will: Average water loss. It’s just, there’s a lot of water loss. 

Oleg: A lot of water losses, is it high or what?

Will: Yes. It’s, like, we want it closer to zero, and this point is seventy-eight. It means that…[UI]…It just means that we lose a lot of water, in general.

00:10:32:00

Katya: Look, maybe somewhere in this area, but where you will lose less water.

Vika: Yes. I’m looking.

Katya: Something right next to it.

Vika: [UI]

Oleg: The only thing is I don’t know how the robots will climb there. It’s a slope. And, there, for meteorologists. Who is responsible for the location? It’s likely…

00:11:00:00

Katya: Meteorology… Ashley is the meteorological…

Oleg: No. Geologist. 

Katya: Oh, geologist. Hydrogeologist.

Oleg: William is a hydrogeologist.

Will: No, it’s Vika.

Katya: No, it’s Vika. 

Oleg: Oh, you are a sedimentologist. 

Will: Mhm. 

Ashley: Nobody…nobody has received a response yet, right? 

Oleg: No. 

Katya: Mhm

Will: Mh-hm.

Ashley: Me neither. 

Vika: Nope. 

00:11:31:00

Katya: Also, thirty-two thirteen is a good enough point. 

Will: Which one? 

Katya: Thirty-two thirteen. Thirty-two thirteen. …Thirteen. …Thirteen. 

Oleg: Oh, yes! It’s absolutely great.

Katya: We’re looking at thirty-two thirteen.

Vika: Yes, we’re looking [SL] and getting amazed.

Oleg: [UI]

00:12:00:00

Oleg: Rocky terrain. 

Vika: Too little water.

Katya: Too little water? 

Oleg: There’s none there.

Vika: Mhm. 

Oleg: But it’s too accurate…

Saleh: Thirty-two what? 

Katya: Thirteen. 

Ashley: Thirty-two thirteen. 

Katya: Thirty-two…

Vika: In terms of contamination, it’s perfect, but in terms of the size it’s not very good.

Katya: I just have the lowest parameters. That is, you understand, this is the maximum ... that is, it’s just a reference point, which I can at least approve.

Oleg: For me, it’s great…//great.

Vika: //There will be too little water.

00:12:30:00

Will: //Yes, and there will be water loss.

Katya: //Is that minimal or just not enough? It’s just that if we have enough, then…

Vika: It’s, like, very little. 

Oleg: So, there won’t be enough water, right?

Katya: I mean, Vika, we need to find exactly something in the middle, so that for everyone...

Vika: Yes, yes, yes, but it’s less than the average.

Katya: Oh, is it less than the average? 

Vika: Yes. 

Katya: Okay. It’s just the lowest point for me. All the indicators of the lowest point.

Ashley: //For me, it’s still not a very big difference between fifteen and thirteen.

Vika: //The previous one, too. 

Katya: Hm…

00:13:02:00

Vika: Fifteen is better for me.

Saleh: Thirty-two fifteen, I think. 

Ashley: Is better? 

Saleh: Is better. 

Will: Fifteen is better. Which one? 

Saleh: Thirty-two fifteen. 

Vika: So far, it’s the best point.

Katya: So, it’s thirty-two fifteen, right? 

Vika: Yes, it seems so. 

Will: Well, it looks that way. 

Saleh: Any information you have, guys? 

Vika; Oh, la, la. Oh, I have it. Thirty-two fifteen. I’m looking at what a beautiful point it is. 

Katya: So, thirty-two fifteen doesn’t work only for William, right?

Vika: Well…

Katya: We lose a lot of water.

Will: I’ll look again. [UI]. Okay, it’s okay. 

00:13:32:00

Will: [SL] Which one…

Oleg: Saleh, which one did you want? 

Saleh: Thirty-two fifteen. 

Will: [UI]. Okay, not bad. 

Saleh: Thirty-two? 

Katya: Fifteen, yes.

Will: [UI]

Oleg: Oh, well, this //at the very beginning, we...

Saleh: //Fifteen.

Katya: We’re talking about it, yes, as…

Oleg: For me, it’s ideal. 

Will: Fifteen seems okay. Thirty-two fifteen.

Ashley: What do you think of forty eighteen? 

00:14:00:00

Katya: Let me take a look. 

Oleg: Forty eighteen? Hold on. 

Vika: Just a second. I think I’ve found something…[UI]

Katya: [whispering] [UI]

Vika: Okay, forty eighteen? 

Oleg: Um…

Katya: Hm…

Oleg: I’m all for it. 

Katya: Well, it’s very expensive. Well, it’s very expensive. 

Oleg: Well, the deposits here are not too deep, large rocks. For me, it’s totally awesome.

00:14:31:00

Ashley: Not great?

Oleg: Good. 

Ashley: Okay. Forty eighteen? 

Oleg: Um-m…

Ashley: Or not? 

Oleg: It’s…hold on.

Katya: Saleh.

Saleh: Depth of water - one thousand three hundred forty-four. 

Oleg: Just a second, hold on.

Saleh: It’s…

Oleg: Oh, there.

Will: Forty…

Katya: It’s too expensive. 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Will: Which one? //What’s the number? 

Katya: //It’s too much. 

Vika: //It’s okay. 

Ashley: Forty eighteen. 

Vika: Oh, forty eighteen? 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Vika: Thirty-one twenty-one. Oh…

Katya: No. Forty eighteen.

Vika: Why? //Where is it from? What is this?

Oleg: //Forty eighteen. The only thing is that the pumps ... it’s deep here.

Saleh: //[UI] water depth

00:15:01:00

Will: Water depth? 

Saleh: Did you see it? 

Oleg: One thousand three hundred and forty-four meters.

Will: //Yes, I see. Yeah. 

Ashley: //Oh, so it’s too…

Katya: For me it’s very good, because more water…

Ashley: Too deep. 

Oleg: Yes, //but given the fact that it’s clean water.

Ashley: //Uh-uh. Okay. 

Katya: //and for us it’s bad because it’s too much…

Oleg: Less filtering. It works. 

Katya: My…

Vika: Okay, I’ll now say for myself.

Ashley: Um. Accessibility… [UI]

Will: It’s a good size. 

Vika: Um…

Oleg: [UI]

Ashley: Accessibility…

Vika: The output won’t be super strong. The water output.

00:15:32:23

Oleg: Large…Okay, forty…

Ashley: Because in this place the accessibility for us is very good and the climate there also looks very good.

Will: Which one is that? 

Ashley: And…forty eighteen. And also in this place seven thousand people can survive...

00:16:02:00

Ashley: get access to this place.

Katya: Forty eighteen. 

Ashley: Team signoff phase has begun.

Oleg: Yes, yes. 

Katya: What is this?

Ashley: What is it? 

Saleh: Why? 

Will: Okay. Alright. Cause it’ll just be like that sometimes. 

Katya: Is that it? Is our time up? 

Will: Alright, so, what are we going with? What number do we choose? Forty-eight fifteen? Thirty…

Oleg: Or…or…

Ashley: Or thirty-two…

Saleh: Wait. What happened now? Where //is the map? 

Oleg: //If…

00:16:30:00

Will: So, it kicked us…it’s still in one of those tabs here but it kicked us over to the team signoff. 

Ashley: But why is the chat not working? 

Will: It may be working. It may not just be on. Maybe this is just for us. We don’t know. But we’re not getting anything from them, so we gotta move on. 

Ashley: Okay. //So, what do you guys think? 

Will: //Okay, now…

Ashley: Thirty-two fifteen or forty eighteen?

Katya: For me, forty-two fifteen – it’s two hundred and forty one hours of work. Forty eighteen – it’s three hundred and five hours of work. A small difference, but the difference is only in the cost.

00:16:59:20

Katya: The cost is almost twice as high. It’s better…

Will: Which one do you choose? 

Katya: Of course, I would choose thirty-two fifteen, but //forty-eighteen is also fine, if it’s better for everyone, then we’ll choose that one.

Will: //Thirty-five fif…thirty-two fifteen…

Oleg: Hm…

Will: Thirty-two fifteen but…

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: But forty eighteen is okay. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: What are you taking? 

Ashley: Um…Yeah, I’m sorry. Let me just…

Will: Okay. Which one do you choose? 

Oleg: I have thirty-two fifteen…

Will: Is thirty-two fifteen okay? 

Oleg: Yes.

Will: What are you taking? 

Vika: Thirty-two fifteen and forty-eighteen work for me.

Will: Thirty-two fifteen? Also works, right? 

00:17:30:00

Katya: Which one is better? 

Vika: Forty eighteen.

Katya: Oh, it doesn’t matter, right? 

Will: Which one are you thinking? 

Ashley: //You said “not important” or…

Saleh: //Thirty-two fifteen? 

Katya: The same.

Will: Thirty-two fifteen. 

Vika: They are about…

Ashley: Alright, that’s fine with me. 

Will: Okay, then, thirty…thirty-two fifteen. 

Ashley: Wait. I got here a response from Martian terrain specialist. 6:40 AM Chicago time. 

Will: What are they saying? 

Ashley: They just said, you know, “We’re here”. Uh, so…We…receive…[UI]

00:18:00:20

Oleg: Oh, they’ve established contact, right?

Katya: So, which one do we choose? Thirty-two fifteen? Which point? 

Ashley: [UI]

Katya: We choose thirty-two fifteen, right? 

Oleg: Well, yes for now. 

00:18:30:00

-

00:19:00:05

Vika: Now we are in our... in our group, yes, geologists?

Ashley: Yeah, so, for now I’m talking with my specific team. 

Will: Me too. I just said: “Hey, good morning. Good to see you. It just kicked us over to the signoff phase. Does it sound right to y’all? I’m writing this at 15:44 Moscow time. Let me know when you receive the shutdown time”

Ashley: Yes. That’s basically along the lines of what I wrote to my team. 

Will: Okay cool. 

00:19:32:10

Oleg: Name [SL] and the rest you didn’t close?

Ashley: Say again. 

Oleg: Name there.

Ashley: Here? 

Oleg: Yes. Yes.

Ashley: On this side? I haven’t done this yet. Um, I...

Oleg: And now you…

Ashley: I’m waiting. I’m talking to my team here, and I told them that we’re here together saying “thirty-two fifteen”.

00:20:00:00

Saleh: Now we will go for that point? //Thirty-two fifteen? 

Ashley: //And I’m waiting for their response. 

Oleg: Yes.

Will: I think so. 

Ashley: Because they’re also…

Will: Who can touch this Map cell? 

Vika: I can. Just select the tab at the top.

Oleg: So, they’ve started to answer me, too.

Ashley: So weird. 

00:20:30:00

Ashley: It looks like they are looking at thirty-two fifteen.

Saleh: Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. So, that’s good. 

Saleh: They are checking it now. 

Ashley: Sorry? 

Saleh: They are checking now. Checking…

00:21:00:00

Katya: Well, okay. Ours has responded, too.

Will: Chop! Hiya! 

Vika: Let’s get some meat. 

Will: Okay. How…how do I click?

Vika: Confirm this.

Will: Yes. I only see “minus one, minus one”.

Vika: Yes, me too.

Ashley: I think somebody else has to enter it, like…

Will: Yeah, that’s what I thought. 

Ashley: Like the operations person or something. 

Katya: [SL] How did you enlarge everything? 

00:21:34:00

Katya: Damn, I…something has happened to my page. 

Oleg: Oh, they wrote //that they are just starting.

Vika: //I don’t have anything at all...I can’t write anything at all. Okay. 

Oleg: And, it’s 6:42 now? Early in the morning? 

00:21:59:10

Will: Well, it’s six forty-seven now.

Katya: William, I’m sorry, you don’t know how, so... Well, it got enlarged for me.

Will: Yes. 

Katya: How can I reduce it? Because…

00:22:34:20

Vika: Yes. It happens. 

Ashley: Alright, I should probably stop writing. Give them a chance to respond. 

Vika: Nein! 

00:22:59:00

Will: [SL] Hello, can you call me Big Sedimentologist? 

Ashley: What? 

Will: What? Okay, yeah. So, I’ve got…we got response from structural geologist. 

Vika: Yep. 

Katya: Oh, cool. 

Will: And operation specialist, but nothing since I responded. So, I don’t know what the delay is. If there is a delay or what? 

Saleh: Hm. 

Ashley: Oh, it’s early morning over there.

Will: A bunch of undergrads. 

Ashley: I mean I would just be waking up and barely functioning at that time, so…

00:23:37:00

Will: Time to party up. You already know what time it is… Morning time. 

Saleh: This delay is good for making tea, you know. 

Will: You want tea? You want tea really bad? I’ll get you your tea soon.

Ashley: No. 

Will: More like, “No”. 

Vika: Be professional. 

00:24:00:10

Will: Tea can be professional. 

Oleg: Katya, so…

Katya: Hm? 

Oleg: It’s for me... I sent the photos taken today

Katya: Mhm. 

Oleg: about mushrooms. 

Katya: Yes, yes, yes.

Oleg: There. And now, apparently, it’s reached the director. He said: “Urgently send off!”

Katya: Ah! Oh. Mushrooms, right? ...Well, what did you manage to, yes, take a picture of?

Oleg: Yes. In short, they weren’t allowed to grow everything.

Vika: Too bad, but still, we can…

00:24:33:00

Vika: Oh la-la. //I think I’ve found another one...another one...

Oleg: //[UI]

Will: //Okay. 

Oleg: Point?

Will: Yeah. 

Vika: Point. Forty twenty-seven. 

Ashley: Forty …

Will: Have they added forty twenty-seven?

Vika: No. I’ve only just found it.

Will: Forty twenty-seven.

Vika: It’s a pretty one. 

Katya: So, [SL] drilling site…

Ashley: Hm…

Vika: Nope. Alright. 

Will: No? 

Ashley: Two red zones for me in this spot.

00:25:00:10

Vika: Okay, so temperature is sixty. It’s so much. 

Oleg: Very deep. But it’s water-bearing, right, for you?

Ashley: Sorry. Say again. Sorry. 

Vika: So, temperature is sixty. 

Saleh: Where? 

Vika: It’s so much. Forty twenty-six. 

Will: Damn…

Saleh: //Forty? 

Vika: //Yeah.

Saleh: //Twenty-six?

Vika: //Yeah. 

Will: //What are you doing? You’re ruining my life.

Ashley: Twenty-six. 

Will: Mhm…

00:25:31:00

Will: There is a decent amount of water there. High water loss, though. That’s not good. 

Vika: Are you talking about forty twenty-six? 

Ashley: So, my messages are kind of //being delayed it seems. 

Will: //Forty twenty-seven. Yeah, I think we’re all being delayed. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Will: Okay. They just came in. “Kind slow we’re finding there. 6:48 local time…”. Okay. So, that…it looks like we’re on a three-minute delay…

00:26:00:00

Will: out, three-minute delay back. So, six-minute turnaround time. See, if it’s 6:40…okay. 

Ashley: That’s right. 

Will: Okay. 

Vika: Oh, they’ve responded to us.

Katya: Okay. [UI]

Will: “Looks like there is three-minute delay. [UI]”

00:26:33:00

Will: Okay. Okay. …[UI]

Vika: Oh. 

Oleg: Please answer the questions. 

00:29:13:20

Ashley: I got a reply from one... one person on my team said “thirty-two fifteen” is too expensive... from the maintenance perspective. 

Saleh: Translate. 

Katya: Our…

Ashley: My maintenance specialist from my team is saying that “thirty-two fifteen” is a little bit expensive for …from a maintenance perspective. 

Will: From the geology team…yeah, that’s…they confirmed that it was okay for most of the geology team it seems to be okay but, yeah, they’re confirming that they were getting some pushback on that. So, they are checking out some different areas. 

00:29:52:00

Katya: And we have an answer about…from our operations specialist. He said that “Our terrain specialist said “It won’t support enough people…enough people. Only six hundred”. Any other ideas?”. And he said that he’s, like…

Oleg: Let’s then, we will...

Katya: It’s seven in the morning, for them. 

Will: And we’re not...we’re not thinking about Signoff right now. They said it didn’t matter. So, we’re not worried about signoff anything. They just said to go ahead and… keep working. 

Ashley: And... from my team, they also said that “forty eighteen” practically doesn’t work,

00:30:29:00

Ashley: because…quantity of water…//there’s practically no water there.

Katya: //Quantity of water. 

Will: //Yes, there’s none there. There’s no water there. There’s none there. 

Oleg: And regarding “thirty-two fifteen”, it’s too expensive, right?

Ashley: Yes. Too expensive, yes. Expensive, yes.

Oleg: Well, we’ll find something now. 

Ashley: Oh, so, basically…And also, “forty eighteen” for my team, they say, basically, doesn’t work because the amount of water there is, basically, zero. 

Saleh: Mhm. 

Ashley: And they are looking at some potentially other locations now. 

00:31:08:00

Oleg: Look, please, five forty-eight.

Will: Zero-five forty-eight, right? 

Oleg: Zero-five forty-eight... It seems to me... Well, for me, it’s just ideal.

Will: Mhm.

00:31:34:10

Will: //There’s no…there’s no water there.

Ashley: //Tell me that one more time.

Oleg: Zero-five forty-eight. Right?

Ashley: Zero-five? 

Will: Yes, but apparently there is no water there. 

Ashley: //Forty-eight.

Katya: //But for me, Oleg, it’s simply the best decision of my life. 

Will: Yes, but if there’s no water there. 

Ashley: So…

Katya: No water, right? //But the ground is so wonderful. 

Ashley: //Zero point five or...

Vika: Wait, somewhere I found...

Katya: //It’s just great.

Will: //You want to make a hole, and there is zero amount of available water. 

Ashley: Five forty-eight.

Katya: Yes, if we do…

Will: And you see that there’s no water there, right?

00:31:59:00

Vika: Yes, I’m looking now. 

Ashley: Oh, where is it? 

Katya: The ground //is so good. [UI]

Ashley: //Oh!

Will: //Five forty-eight? 

Vika: Yes, yes. There’s very little water and too small…

Ashley: It’s too bad for me. There are six red zones, seven orange…

Katya: Mhm. 

Will: There’s no water there, so it doesn’t matter. 

Vika: The water basin is very small.

Ashley: Is there no water there? 

Will: There is no water. 

Vika: //Only...only...only surface water.

Ashley: //There’s no water at all either, so... none.

Oleg: //Yes. 

Vika: And //it will be very…very bad…there will be water running away and there will be a bad water output.

Ashley: //Sorry. 

00:32:37:10

Katya: Eight forty-eight is the same, right?

Oleg: We haven’t considered eight forty-eight yet.

Katya: Look. Maybe…

Oleg: So, eight forty-eight…

00:33:03:15

Oleg: Mh-hm. 

Katya: Hm? 

Oleg: Very muddy and dirty... But if there’s no alternative, we can. That is, it doesn’t run out ... Although, the temperature for extraction there is very comfortable – twenty-four degrees.

00:33:31:15

Katya: Which one? Eight forty-eight, right? 

Will: Let’s do, thirty… thirty thirty-nine. 

Katya: Thirty thirty-nine.

Oleg: Thirty thirty-nine.

Katya: Thirty-nine…

Ashley: Who is the type…the person that can say the amount of water that’s available in that area? 

Will: Me. 

Ashley: You? 

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Will: So, in this area there is eighty-eight thousand…

Oleg: Oh, no!

Vika: It doesn’t work. It doesn’t work.

Will: No? 

Ashley: Hm…

Will: Okay.

Oleg: Too muddy and //dirty water.

Saleh: //What is it? The number? 

Ashley: The climate is really bad, so...

Katya: //Thirty thirty-nine. 

Will: //Thirty thirty-nine. Okay. 

00:34:01:00

Ashley: Not good. 

Vika: Thirty thirty-nine? 

Will: Yeah. //It doesn’t work.

Katya: //It doesn't work for her. You don’t need to look. 

Will: Okay, and twenty-two thirty-eight. 

Ashley: Twenty-two thirty-eight. 

Oleg: Yes…

Saleh: Twenty-two…

Will: Twenty-two thirty-eight. 

Katya: Hm. //[UI]

Ashley: //Not very good for me either. 

Will: Not very good? 

Vika: Not at all. 

00:34:30:20

Will: Not at all? 

Vika: Mhm. 

Ashley: How do you say “orange” in Russian? 

Will: Orange.

Ashley: Oh. 

Vika: And there isn’t that much water there. 

Oleg: The water is very murky there…

Will: There? In twenty-two thirty-eight? 

Vika: Yes.

Oleg: Yes. 

Will: What do you mean? There are one hundred and sixty-two thousand. 

Vika: //There, the depth of the water basin is six hundred and twenty-seven, which means that...

Ashley: //Twenty-two thirty-eight…has a lot of orange, yellow and red zones. 

Will: What?

Saleh: //Who is responsible to select?

Vika: //The water output will be bad. 

Will: Oh, yes. But there’s water there. 

Oleg: //But there it’s very…

Saleh: //Who is responsible to select the point? 

00:35:00:20

Will: There’s water you can’t use //[UI]

Ashley: //I think, any of us right now can suggest to them, like, a point. Um…

Oleg: //Yes, it’s dirty. 

Will: [SL] Ten thousand. 

Ashley: But…and once we, as a team, agree then they…then we relay that to others. 

Katya: What is our main task? To find a place with some water?

Will: //[SL] Download and win.

Oleg: //Agree with everyone that we have...

Katya: No. It’s clear that we won’t find the ideal place, for sure. We must pursue, it turns out, the main common goal. To find water, in general.

Vika: We didn’t like the first point solely because of the high cost, right?

Oleg: Well, Ashley didn’t like it.

00:35:30:10

Vika: The one that’s…thirty-two fifteen.

Oleg: Ash.

Ashley: Say again. 

Oleg: That’s too expensive, right?

Ashley: Thirty-two fifteen?

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: Yes. They…they…on my team, they said it was expensive. Expensive.

Will: And thirty…

Ashley: But…

Will: Eighteen? 

Oleg: Thirty eighteen? 

Will: Thirty eighteen. 

00:36:04:00

Oleg: Thirty eighteen… Well, that’s... Oops... It's both mineral and muddy.

Vika: I don’t like the size of the water basin.

Oleg: Very dirty water. 

Will: What do you mean? 

Vika: In terms of the size…

Saleh: What’s the last point? 

Vika: In terms of the size of limited…

Saleh: Huh? 

Will: Well, a small one, yes. 

Saleh: Guys. 

Vika: Hm? 

Saleh: The last point?

Will: Thirty eighteen. 

00:36:30:00

Will: But it doesn’t look good. 

Saleh: Thirty-one forty-four. 

Ashley: Thirty-one forty-four? 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Will: I’m just looking for water now. Twenty-four thirty-three. Twenty-four thirty-three. 

Ashley: Let me look at Saleh’s first. 

Will: Okay. They are telling us “Twenty-five forty-one”. 

Oleg: Oops, damn.

Will: Twenty-five…

00:37:00:00

-

00:37:26:15

Vika: What is this?

00:38:05:15

Vika: Twenty-four thirty-three – there’s a lot of mineral contamination. It’s very bad.

Will: Twenty-five forty-one? 

Vika: Hm? 

Will: Twenty-five forty-one? 

Ashley: [UI]

Katya: What point are you talking about? 

Will: Twenty-five…

Vika: We had twenty-four…

Saleh: What is it? 

Will: They suggested twenty-five forty-one. 

Vika: Okay. 

Katya: [UI]

Will: Hm…Hm…small, but… Although…

00:38:31:10

Vika: It’s okay.

Will: It’s okay. 

Vika: It’s okay. //I like it. 

Oleg: //Say again.

Katya: Oops, oops, oops.

Will: Okay. //Okay. Twenty-five forty-one.

Katya: //No. Not very much.

Vika: No? 

Oleg: Twenty-five…

Will: Twenty-five forty-one. 

Oleg: Forty-one.

Will: Twenty-five forty-one? 

Oleg: Twenty-five…

Will: It’s okay for us. How does twenty-five forty-one look like for you? 

Ashley: If they would stop putting questions on my screen…

Will: Oh, yeah. 

Ashley: Sorry. 

Will: I think there’s six in total, so…

Oleg: It’s awesome. It’s just ideal.

Will: Awesome. Good.

Oleg: It’s…

Saleh: It’s too deep…What do you think, Kate? 

00:39:00:00

Katya: The same, I think. 

Saleh: Hm.

Ashley: Too deep? 

Saleh: Too deep? 

Ashley: Alright, so, what was the…//what was the number again? I’m sorry. 

Saleh: //So…and for you, I think, it’s good but for us it would be…this is…

Ashley: Repeat the number, please.

Saleh: Too expensive. 

Will: //Let me tell them that. 

Oleg: //Twenty-five…

Vika: //Twenty-five forty-one. Twenty-five forty-one. 

Katya: Saleh, for me was, like…interesting information that thirty-two fifteen is very expensive, because it is the most cheapest point we have before. 

Saleh: Hm. 

00:39:30:00

Katya: And they sent a message to //Ashley that it’s…

Saleh: //Ashley, yeah…expensive for the maintenance. 

Katya: Yes. So, if, like, six hundred is very expensive…I mean depth. 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Katya: What about one thousand and forty…four hundred? 

Saleh: Hm. 

00:40:10:10

Saleh: Look for thirty-one forty-four. 

Katya: A moment…Operation specialist sent me a message about point two and eight. 

Will: Zero two zero eight? 

Katya: Yeah. [SL] Maybe. 

00:40:31:10

Katya: [SL] Where is it? 

Will: Okay. Looks okay from my end. 

Vika: It’s okay. 

Katya: Yeah? 

Will: Yeah. 

Saleh: Which one? 

Ashley: Which one? 

Vika: Um…

Katya: Two eight. 

Will: Two eight. 

Vika: But //it’s a bit muddy.

Ashley: //Two eight? 

Will: Yeah. 

Vika: So, we have…//we have the best points.

Ashley: //Wow. Two? 

Oleg: So…

Will: What? 

Katya: //Two eight.

Vika: //The previous points…

Oleg: Two eight? 

Vika: were better. //Twenty-five forty-one and thirty-two fifteen.

Will: //Yes, but it doesn’t work for them.

Katya: It costs three times more to build there.

00:41:02:00

Will: If it works, then it works.

Saleh: Depth is mediocre. 

Will: Oh, but it’s the average water loss of one. 

Oleg: It’s too muddy there. Although, it is cloudy, but not much. The depth is not great. // How much do you have there?

Saleh: //Is there anything wrong with the point? 

Will: There is some water loss. 

Vika: Well, it concerns me that the depth is small.

Saleh: How is it? Huh? 

Will: Huh? 

Saleh: What is the…

Will: It says there is a complete water loss, but it also says that it’s got a lot of water available, //so I don’t know.

Saleh: //Where? Where? 

Will: Right here. 

Ashley: [UI]

00:41:31:00

Saleh: Average water loss. Okay. 

Will: Yeah. Yes, it doesn’t work because we lose all the water.

Oleg: What is it there? 

Will: A whole lot of water.

Saleh: [UI]

Oleg: And, in general, where can settlements be located?

Will: Huh?

Oleg: Who has information about where the settlements can be located?

Katya: The human factors experts have this one.

Vika: Oh. 

00:42:01:00

Oleg: Where is it better for them? Because it’s transportation. Someone has to think about it.

Katya: [UI]

Oleg: Oh, here – human. 

Katya: [UI]

00:42:30:00

-

00:42:59:20

Will: So... I told them that at “zero-two zero-eight” we will lose all the water.

Oleg: Zero-two zero-eight – what is it? 

Will: It was that…

Vika: The last point.

Will: The last point.

Oleg: Oh. 

00:43:30:20

Katya: [UI]

-

00:44:00:00

-

00:44:33:00

Will: Hm. 

Katya: Hm.

Will: Four eighteen. What does it look like? Four eighteen. 

Saleh: [UI]

00:45:01:10

Will: Probably, it’s too deep, right? What do you think? 

Katya: Four eighteen? Wait a second. 

Oleg: Say again, what was that? 

Will: Four eighteen. 

Oleg: Four eighteen.

Katya: Four eighteen. 

Vika: Mineral pollution will ruin the equipment.  

Katya: Twice as deep as…

Oleg: No, it’s muddy. The mineral levels are at zero there. 

Will: Oh…

Vika: Mineral.

Oleg: Oh, hold on, hold on. 

Will: //One lower. 

Vika: //Four eighteen. 

00:45:30:10

Will: Four seventeen? Are you looking at four seventeen? 

Vika: Four eighteen.

Will: Oh, four eighteen.

Oleg: Oh, yes. It’s mineral, too.

Ashley: Four eighteen is not bad.

Vika: But it’s bad for the equipment...But not super critical, on the other hand. Um…

Oleg: [UI]. //I have thirty-five...mineral.	

Ashley: //Population reached is, like, four times as high as some of the other locations, which is great. 

Saleh: //[UI]

Ashley: And there is, really, only two orange zones that are negative, so we can deal with that with training if the costs don’t have to go towards anything else.

Vika: //I don’t really like the size of the water basin.

00:46:05:25

Ashley: I’m okay with four eighteen. And is there a lot…there is a lot of water there? 

Vika: Nope. 

Will: There is…there is not a lot, but there is…there is…it’s…it’s…it’s like…there is, like…you can get at a larger portion of it. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Oleg: Well, if it’s just mineral, I can remove the mineral.

00:46:30:15

Vika: Are you removing the mineral ones?

Oleg: Yes. 

Vika: Oh. Well…

Oleg: And, in principle, the value is not so great.

Vika: But I don’t like the size of these water basins. Size of [SL] UCA

Oleg: Are they big? 

Vika: No. They’re small. 

Oleg: So…

00:47:02:00

Oleg: [UI]…[PH] Well…well…well…well…They aren’t writing for some reason. They are sleeping. Are they writing to you? 

Katya: Yes. 

00:47:30:00

Katya: Mine are seriously considering two and eight. And another specialist wrote to me… now I’ll tell you… from the space human factor. It’s yours, Ashley. He asked me about point two eight, and I sent him the individual information. And... now, let’s see.

00:48:17:20

Saleh: Did you see the…two point eight? 

Will: [SL] Where? 

Saleh: The question.

Katya: Question? What question? 

Saleh: Yeah, what they are asking. 

Katya: What are they asking? 

Ashley: Yeah. They told me to look at two eight also. Have you…have you all looked at two point eight yet? //Two eight. Two eight, yes.

Oleg: //Yes. Two eight. Yes, hold on...

Saleh: For drilling method you have…

Katya: Yes. I sent him “percussion jetting drilling method. 

00:48:47:04

Saleh: Which one? The last one? Percussion jetting, yeah? 

Katya: Mhm. 

Saleh: Most complex…//[UI]

Oleg: //Well, basically...so, thirty-two. These are cloudy impurities... You can remove it. It works for me.

Will: Which one? 

Oleg: Two eighteen...two eight...Insignificant...

00:49:17:10

Will: This doesn’t work for me.

Ashley: No?

Katya: Absolutely not? //Or, maybe, not ideal? 

Will: //We have 100% water loss.

Vika: Oh. 

Will: Yes.

Ashley: Losses? 

Katya: So, two eight is definitely not an option, right? 

Will: Loss.

Ashley: Oh. 

Will: 100% of water is lost. 

Ashley: Oh. 

Will: In the system. 

Katya: Two eight – definitely not, right, William?

Will: Yes. Definitely not.

Ashley: Did you…

Katya: [sighs]. You can write to the materials… to our specialist…

Oleg: We have fifteen minutes to make a…

Saleh: [UI]

Oleg: decision.

00:49:48:10

Ashley: So, you said that…sorry, you said “two eight” //you lose all of the water. 

Will: //Yes, yes, yes. He has written. Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. 

00:50:22:15

Katya: Have we looked at thirty-seven twenty-six?

Ashley: Thirty-seven twenty-six.

Katya: It’s some new point. 

Katya: [SL] Thirty-six. 	

Will: Hm…

Ashley: Not bad.

Will: It seems…a small one, but it works. Although…

00:50:55:00

Will: It’s okay.

Vika: What point is that? 

Katya: Thirty-seven twenty-six.

Oleg: Okay, thirty-seven twenty-six.

Vika: Hm-mhm.

Ashley: No? 

Katya: No? 

Vika: No. 

Oleg: Oh, well!

Katya: Not at all? 

Vika: Not at all.

00:51:29:00

Oleg: It’s polluted in all the aspects. Actually, the water is very bad.

Will: Which one? Thirty-seven twenty-six – no?

Katya: Don’t even check. It still doesn’t work for anyone.

Ashley: Well, you...you chose “thirty-two fifteen” first, right?

Oleg: Yes.

Katya: But they didn’t like it. The people on the ground didn’t like it.

Ashley: On the ground? 

Oleg: Expensive. 

Ashley: Yes, but I can ask if it’s so expensive that we can’t use it.

Katya: If there are no other options.

Ashley: They said…

00:51:59:00

Ashley: I think we only have ten minutes left.

Oleg: Yes. 

Ashley: Hm… Will, in terms of the water… that’s the most important thing.

00:52:30:10

Ashley: Or a hydrogeologist.

Katya: Mhm. 

Will: What? Which one? 

Ashley: Actually, there’s this…there’s an area there, so that it’s generally okay…maybe, get… 

Will: I mean, it’s…I don’t know.

Ashley: Where is the part that says about…

Will: The…nothing that we haven’t already thrown out. 

Saleh: Kate, did you see the chat? 

00:52:59:20

Katya: Yes, but I don’t have a message. 

Saleh: And…robotics.

Katya: Oh, robotics. 

Oleg: There, they suggested… zero-six forty-one.

Katya: Hold on. 

Oleg: Who suggested it? It’s the mechanic.

Vika: Check nineteen two, please… What else did you say, Oleg? //Six forty-one.

Oleg: //Six forty-one. 

Ashley: Is anyone on Space Robotics here? You’re on Space Robotics, right? 

00:53:30:10

Saleh: Both of us.

Ashley: Are you both Space…Space robotics? 

Katya: Yes. 

Ashley: Um…

Katya: Damn, which one did you say we should check? Nine and two? 

Vika: Six forty-one. 

Katya: Six forty-one?

Ashley: Do you know if the parts…// the parts you will be using, will it be internal or local or specialized? 

Will: //There’s no water. There’s no water. 

Katya: What are you talking about? 

Ashley: What materials or parts will you be using?

Katya: It’s important for us… for me… what kind of ground, depth and…

Vika: Nineteen two. 

Katya: I’ll say now what else. 

00:54:03:05

Will: Twenty…twenty //four…

Katya: //Type of ground, depth and what…

Vika: Fourteen, yes? 

Will: Fourteen, yes. 

Katya: What part, yes.

Ashley: And what part.

Katya: Yes. For me, it gives me...

Oleg: Forty-two fourteen, right? 

Katya: Relevance.

Vika: Twenty-four fourteen.

Katya: I have from 0.5 to one. I mean, I’m not looking either. But there weren’t more than six or eight now, so...

Oleg: So…

Katya: There’s a slight difference between the points in terms of the last factor.

00:54:30:10

Oleg: Hm…

Will: Twenty-four fourteen? 

Oleg: Yes.

Will: For you? It works for me. Vika? 

Vika: I’m looking now. Yes, it’s possible.

Will: Okay. //So, we’ve got half the crew. Half.

Katya: //Which one, say again? 

Ashley: //Wait, what was it? 

Will: Twenty //four fourteen.

Oleg: //four fourteen. Absolutely awesome.

Ashley: Twenty-four fourteen? 

Will: Yeah. 

Oleg: Small inclusions, clean water.

Will: Twenty-four fourteen. [UI]

Oleg: Does it work for you, too? 

Ashley: It’s possible. 

00:55:02:00

Katya: It’s just the borderline.

Will: Borderline? 

Katya: Possible, possible. What about you, Saleh? 

Saleh: Um…it’s okay. This one. 

Oleg: Okay? 

Vika: //Twenty-four fourteen? 

Ashley: //Not the best, but possible. 

Saleh: For depth, the water depth for us is okay. 

00:55:28:00

Katya: I need all info from drilling to us. Okay…Two and eight. Just a second. Two and eight. 

00:55:58:00

Will: Okay, so, twenty-four fourteen is…

Oleg: Wow! Mechanical engineer. So…[UI]

Ashley: Man, two eight really didn’t work for you, huh? //They are stuck on that. 

Will: //For me? It’s so weird, cause it’s, like…

00:56:29:00

Will: I mean, average water loss. So, due to the permeation of the values zero to one, it’s one. 

Ashley: Really? 

Will: Yeah. 

Saleh: Which one? This one? 

Will: This is the average water loss of the…of the thing, so, like. 

Ashley: Is that of the system? //Like, it loses that much water when it’s trying to pump it? 

Oleg: //Wattage…wattage – what is this? Wattage. 

Will: It’s…no, it’s from the…

00:56:53:00

Will: //it’s…the recharge loss and [SL] intrasorurceful loss. The average amount of water that is inaccessible due to the permeation of the hydraulic…can follow…hydraulic [SL] confining bed layers. This is a combination of recharge loss. So, how much is coming in and it’s losing on the way in and how much it is losing in between. If it’s one, I mean, it loses…

Oleg: //Vika, wattage – what is it? 

Vika: //I don’t know what wattage is. 

Oleg: //Wattage…wattage…Does it use three hundred wattage or three hundred…volts? 

Vika: //I don’t know what it is.  

Oleg: //No, then, volts…

Vika: //It may be simply for…

Katya: //It’s for…for drilling, it’s drilling information.

Ashley: Yeah, okay. 

Katya: He is writing about two and eight, yes? Three hundred wattage. Fifty…

Will: So, we’re waiting…

Oleg: Yes, yes, yes. 

Katya: Yes, he’s writing to me about drilling. //But that doesn’t work for William.

Will: //We’re waiting for an answer... Twenty-four fourteen doesn’t work?

Katya: Will, can you please write to our operations specialist? 

Will: What? 

Katya: //That two and eight doesn’t work for you.

Ashley: //It’s saying, like, everybody is having good … it’s so funny.

Will: //I’ve written already, I’ve written already. 

Katya: //[UI]

00:57:30:00

Ashley: You’ve already let everyone know that “two eight” is not okay? 

Will: Yeah.

Ashley: Because everyone else is saying, like, “Two eight is so great!”

Will: Yeah, they did. They…they…they…

Ashley: Yeah, okay. 

Will: I…I…I…

Ashley: Okay. 

Will: To the structural geologist and…

Ashley: //And the engineering team. Did you tell the engineering team too? 

Vika: //Thirty-three thirty-one, please check.

Oleg: Thirty-three thirty-one… hold on. Thirty-three...thirty-three thirty-one.

Will: Point nine ninety-eight is lost.

00:57:58:00

Will: Thirty-seven twenty-six, they’re saying. Thirty-seven twenty-six...

Oleg: Oh, oh…Okay. 

Vika: Thirty-three thirty-one – is it okay?

Oleg: //Yes, thirty…

Will: //It’s not okay for me. Not okay for me.

Katya: //Thirty-three thirty-one – so, it’s a stretch.

Will: It doesn’t work. Point ninety-eight…//Ninety-eight percent loss.

Oleg: //[UI]

Will: Okay. 

Oleg: [UI] because water… Oh, not enough water. Well, two and eight they all...smashed it.

00:58:38:00

Katya: Again, very expensive. Again. Any other options?

Will: Well, we’re waiting for an answer about twenty-four fourteen.

Oleg: Twenty-four fourteen. 

Will: Yes, we’re still waiting for an answer to this.

Oleg: So…

Katya: Twenty-four fourteen, yes? 

Will: Yes. So, like, I know it’s on the border, but...

Oleg: Oh, they’re considering it now.

Katya: Damn, for me, twenty-four fourteen is very much okay. 

00:59:05:10

Katya: Fourteen…

Oleg: So…

Katya: Four…

Vika: Oops.

Katya: Fourteen…

Ashley: There’re five minutes left. 

Oleg: So, what are we doing? Making a decision? 

Ashley: Well, it was already four minutes ago, I think.

Katya: They’re taking a long time to respond, by the way. 

Ashley: Yes. Well, because there is…

00:59:30:20

Will: There are six minutes //between us.

Katya: //Maybe, they’re discussing.

Ashley: There’s a six-minute…delay. 

Katya: //Delay, yes.

Will: //Three minutes there and three minutes back.

Oleg: Oh, we have five minutes…//Point…

Will: //Thirty-two and six doesn’t really work.

Oleg: [UI]

Ashley: At first, we said “thirty-two fifteen”

Oleg: Yes, well, that one works.

Ashley: But, //they said it was a little expensive...

Will: //I’ve written to them…

Katya: And who said that Saleh and I are responsible for money? So strange… Who decides that it’s more expensive?

Katya: Do you have another person on the team? 

Ashley: So, on my team…

Katya: He didn’t say anything. Operation specialist. 

01:00:00:15

Katya: Who told you…

Ashley: //My team said that from…

Saleh: //Who is operation specialist? 

Katya: Her team said that. 

Saleh: Who is operation specialist? 

Will: I don’t know. //It’s just the operation specialist. 

Katya: //It’s our…

Saleh: I know, yeah. //But why is he not responding? 

Vika: //Thirty-two twenty-six doesn’t work at all.

Will: He’s responding to me. We’ve got a good working relationship. 

Saleh: He’s talking to you? 

Will: Yeah. 

Saleh: Really? 

Katya: Her team said that it’s too much expensive. 

Ashley: But I think, you know what? Let’s just…

Will: We’ve just got to get a response on twenty-four fourteen. We just don’t have a response yet. 

Saleh: Hm. We asked them also. 

Will: Yeah, I asked the operations specialist and the structural geologist. 

01:00:29:00

Ashley: If twenty-four fourteen doesn’t work, I think that we should resort back to thirty-two fifteen because…

Will: Thirty-two fifteen.

Ashley: if it’s just a little expensive on the maintenance side, maybe we can make that work. 

Will: //Okay, let’s see here. 

Katya: //But it’s good water, good place.

Ashley: //If it’s good for everybody else. Was it good water for you?

Vika: Yes. 

Katya: It’s just too expensive, so…

Ashley: It was good for hydrogeology…

Will: I mean…Not so good. They say, “not so good”. 

Ashley: For what? Twenty-four fourteen? 

Will: But…but not…it’s not negative. 

Ashley: Okay, but you…what was //the water situation like at thirty-two fifteen in the beginning? 

Vika: //For me it’s okay. 

Will: //Thirty-two fifteen. 

Katya: //Let’s say thirty-two fifteen, okay. 

Oleg: Which one?

Will: It’s okay. 

01:01:00:00

Katya: Thirty-two fifteen, after all, Oleg.

Oleg: Well, there, I also... Thirty-two fifteen, I have...

Katya: Well, for me, in general, it’s okay. I don’t know what’s there...

Will: Twenty-five forty-one.

Katya: The spot is bad, of course. Just the bottom line, but...

Ashley: What did you say? 

Oleg: But…

Will: They just sent me a new point – twenty-five forty-one. 

Saleh: We already used it. 

Oleg: But if there’s no water, someone said…//Will, did you say that there’s no water?

Katya: //Yes, thirty-two fifteen – no water?

Saleh: //It was not good for us. 

Will: In which one? 

Vika: There isn’t a lot of water there.

Oleg: //Thirty-two fifteen.

Saleh: //For us it’s too expensive. 

Vika: Yes.

Ashley: Yeah, what did you say about thirty-two fifteen? 

Vika: //Well, it’s good in terms of contamination, but...

Will: //It works, but it’s…

Ashley: I’m gonna say: // “Everyone here likes thirty-two fifteen.”

Oleg: //But, here, I have this…for human, who said, 

01:01:30:13

Oleg: he doesn’t object. 

Vika: Thirty-two fifteen isn’t too different...for me.

Katya: [UI]

Vika: Hold on. Twenty-four fourteen. 

01:02:20:25

Ashley: They say: “Everyone in Martian Analysis group is heavily leaning on “two eight””. How is that possible? That’s the one that you said has no water, right?

Will: Yeah. 

Saleh: He said he can’t do “twenty-four fourteen”.

Ashley: Yeah. 

Oleg: [UI]

Saleh: So, he’s suggesting now twenty-five forty-one. 

01:02:59:00

Ashley: Which one? Twenty-five forty-one? 

Saleh: No, this…

Ashley: What did you say? 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Ashley: Oh, we’ve already had that one before. 

Saleh: Yeah. We’re asking him now about thirty-two…

Ashley: No, that one is horrible. 

Saleh: Yeah. Yeah. 

Ashley: That one is really horrible. 

Will: Which one? 

Ashley: I hope, thirty-two fifteen just works. Let’s just…//Twenty-five forty-one is horrible.

Saleh: //[UI] 

01:03:26:20

Ashley: Alright. 

Will: Thirty-two fifteen, you said? 

Ashley: Yeah. I feel like…I mean, like you said, it’s gonna be a little more expensive for us, but…I think it’s probably worth it for everyone else, so…Let’s see if there is an agreement. 

01:03:57:10

Ashley: [UI]

Vika: Ash

Ashley: Yeah. 

Vika: Tell me please, um…What is your quality…so, temperature? Not quality, but highest…

Ashley: Like, temperature?

Vika: Temperature. 

01:04:30:10

Vika: //So…so…

Ashley: //So, I don’t really deal with temperature. 

Vika: Oh. Oh, so, sorry…So, what are you thinking about thirty-five twenty? 

Ashley: Twenty-five what?

Vika: Twenty. Thirty-five…Thirty-five twenty. 

Ashley: Oh, thirty-five. 

01:05:05:20

Ashley: Pretty darn good for me! 

Vika: Okay. 

Ashley: Um…

Oleg: So, let’s decide. To me, here, not one... More precisely, they answered, but... no one said anything against thirty-two seventeen. Oh! Now, human is saying something...

Vika: Thirty-two fifteen. 

Will: They’re saying: “We’re doing it – twenty-five forty-one”.

01:05:31:00

Oleg: Twenty-five forty-one? 

Will: That they’ll just do it. 

Ashley: Forty-one. What? No! That’s horrible!

Will: Twenty-five forty-one.

Katya: Oh, my God.

Ashley: That’s horrible!

Saleh: Why? What’s the reason?

Katya: For me, it’s okay.

Ashley: Because there are seven, six and three respectively yellow orange red zones which means that there’s gonna be a lot of dust storms. Why did we go with that one?

01:06:04:00

Oleg: What, has it stopped for us already? 

Ashley: Yeah, I think so. 

Vika: Not for me. 

Oleg: I already…oh, shoot, [UI]

Ashley: So, basically…

Katya: So, I can’t open my messages for some reason.

Oleg: That’s all. We’ve run out of time.

Vika: Oh, yes, you said they sent twenty-five forty-one.
 
Ashley: So, who puts the…are they putting…

01:06:30:00

Saleh: They said, twenty…//twenty-five forty-one. 

Ashley: //They are going with twenty-five forty-one? This is horrible. 

Will: I mean, it’s always gonna be horrible for somebody, right? But, I mean, I’m not sure. 

Ashley: Especially horrible. //I mean, it’s better with thirty-two fifteen. 

Saleh: //[UI]

Will: Yeah. 

Saleh: [SL] Drilling – one hundred eight. 

Oleg: Not working. 

Saleh: Steel. 

01:07:00:00

Oleg: Is it working for everyone? …It’s not working for me. 

Vika: Mine is working. 

Oleg: I can’t add points… Can you tell me, is your water is murky there or not?

Vika: Where? 

Oleg: Twenty-five forty-one… The water composition.

Vika: No. 

Oleg: Okay? 

Vika: Just large... large... large pollutant particles.

01:07:31:25

Oleg: And that’s all, yes? 

Vika: Mhm…But it doesn’t work for Will. 

Oleg: Too little water, yes? 

Will: It’s, like…

Vika: One hundred percent loss.

Will: One hundred percent loss.

Oleg: One hundred percent loss? 

Ashley: So, where…Are you in the signoff right now? 

Will: No. 

Ashley: Okay, so, that’s…

Katya: What? Thirty-two fifteen, I’m writing, yes, that’s what we want?

Vika: Yes. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

01:08:00:00

-

01:08:50:15

Will: And how…who can enter…

Vika: I can’t.

Saleh: Twenty-five forty-one. 

Will: Alright, twenty-five forty-one. That’s what I’m gonna do. 

Ashley: That’s not what we’re gonna do, but…

Will: I mean…So, who can put in…

Saleh: All of us are happy except Ashley. 

Will: Who can enter this?

Ashley: For twenty-five forty-one? 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Will: I’m not happy with it, but, I mean, it is what it is, so, twenty-five forty-one…

Saleh: But I mean the whole team there. 

Ashley: But how can you…

Katya: For me it’s terrible. 

Will: Who can enter? 

Ashley: I can’t. I do not…I’m not able to. 

Will: Okay. 

Ashley: So, I’m not sure…

01:09:23:00

Ashley: [SL] Is there anything that they’re writing here? 

Vika: What time was it, was it 2:40 when we started? 

Will: Oh. Sedimentologist…hold on.

Ashley: //[UI]…Only the geology team members can drag and drop [UI]

Oleg: //[UI]

Will: Okay, so, //[UI]

Oleg: //[UI]

Katya: Only Geology team members. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Katya: And who do we have as geologists? 

Vika: It’s us, Will and I.

Will: That’s us. 

Katya: Well, okay. 

Vika: And our friend. 

Will: But I can…

Vika: Oh, and I can. 

Oleg: So…

Will: Can you map cell?

Oleg: And, I only…

Vika: No, it’s just that I don’t understand where.

01:10:00:15

Ashley: Let’s say thirty-two fifteen. //I’m just kidding. 

Vika: //Oh, I can put it here. 

Saleh: Huh? 

Ashley: I’m telling her, she should just put “thirty-two fifteen” in. 

Vika: And where…where do I enter? 

Katya: Right here, perhaps. Map cell. 

Oleg: Um-m…

Vika: No, I can’t. 

Oleg: In the central panel.

Saleh: [UI]

Ashley: Soon, Saleh. You got an apple next to you if you need. 

Vika: No, I can’t. 

Oleg: Ash.

Ashley: Yes.

Oleg: //Tell me, please. Here, look, the central one is right here. You filled it out, didn’t you?

Vika: //Will, is it working for you? 

Will: //Mhm-hm.

Ashley: Not yet for me, because I can’t see…Okay. 

01:10:30:00

Ashley: Something has changed here. And who is planetary geology? Someone… someone needs to… give the numbers for Cell X and Cell Y.

Vika: I can’t enter anything yet.

Will: Okay, okay, okay…So…

Oleg: I can’t enter either. 

Will: Average…Material of average TBA. [UI]. Why can’t I…

01:10:59:00

Will: Cannot calculate. 

Oleg: I can’t enter. Can you enter things or not? 

Ashley: What? It’s been reset. 

Katya: Operation [SL] spell. Okay. 

Saleh: Ah…

Katya: Reset.

Oleg: [UI]

Saleh: It has been reset, Will. 

Ashley: Who is putting the maps off? 

Oleg: Oh, wow!

Ashley: Shut up!

01:11:30:25

Ashley: [SL] Now that you view my computer. 

Katya: I can’t view messages from… Vika, please tell me what I’m doing wrong. Look, I click on it and it doesn’t appear. It’s all frozen for me, yes?

Vika: Try clicking here…No, maybe, it’s…

Katya: Oh, okay.

Ashley: Why is it so…ugh…

01:12:07:11

Katya: I’m being ignored by the maintenance specialist. I wrote to him that it’s too deep, and he writes to me that they’ve chosen point twenty-five forty-one.

Vika: They’re all signing off.

01:12:36:28

Katya: Well, okay. 

Vika: Just you and us are left. 

Ashley: How is it, like…ugh…

Katya: I think they’re taking [UI]

Will: Can you see that it’s minus one minus one?

Vika: Yes, minus one minus one.

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: Yeah, I see it too. And why can’t I give my…ugh…decision for human factors? 

Oleg: Vika, have you done it there? 

Vika: No.

Oleg: Is anything being filled out for you?

Vika: No. 

01:13:02:10

Oleg: I can’t do anything. Has anyone completed, at least, signoff? …Will, are you filling out signoff? 

Vika: Signoff. 

Katya: Where is that? 

Will: No.

Vika: This thing here.

Oleg: In the center. 

Saleh: Why? 

Katya: //What’s happened? What’s happened? 

Ashley: //I didn’t input my stuff yet! 

Saleh: Martian meteorology specialist. You, huh?

Ashley: Give me a second! I need to input my decisions here! 

01:13:30:15

Katya: //[SL] Three hundred and twenty-four hours ago.

Ashley: //Oh, mother…my thing is, like, freezing!

Saleh: You signed off already. 

Ashley: I’m about to, if I can put my numbers in here. 

Oleg: [UI]

Vika: Oh. Oh. 

Ashley: Oh, come on! It’s so slow! Ugh…

Vika: Is it working? 

Oleg: What point did we decide on in the end?

Katya: What can be done here?!

Ashley: [SL] Attempt to modify…what? 

Katya: Where can I learn what point it is, in general? 

Ashley: Oh, my god!

Katya: What?

Saleh: [UI]

Ashley: It’s just not…okay, that’s fine. 

01:14:00:00

Vika: Why? What? What? 

Katya: What?

Ashley: Okay. Sedimentologist. Okay, so, that’s you. 

Will: That’s me. I did it, so that I could see if I could…

Katya: What are they doing? Explain. 

Oleg: Well, right now, they are retrieving the message about [UI]…process reset. 

Ashley: Yeah, I was gonna say, like, I really didn’t get any chance to input my…//But I haven’t yet given the decisions here.

Will: //Alright, fine. I’m not gonna…I’m not gonna try anymore. I’m just gonna stay. 

Oleg: How did you open this? Oh, this thing…

Katya: What are you doing? 

Vika: It was just my turn. And I have nothing here [UI]

Ashley: Oh, thank you!

01:14:30:00

Vika: Sorry. 

Ashley: No, that’s fine for me. 

Katya: What point is it? 

Vika: Oh, really? 

Ashley: I just wanted to add in my decision here. Oh, fuck!

Katya: What point is it?

Vika: What point? Yes, I don’t understand.

Katya: Yes. What are we talking about... everyone is turning it off, but what are we talking about? What point did we choose?

Vika: It’s, in short, my… well, it’s not my turn anymore.

Katya: I can’t even specify the drilling method because... Oh, that’s it. I’ll stay silent.

01:15:05:05

Vika: Can you? 

Katya: Everything is frozen for me here. 

Will: You can do it. 

Oleg: Oh, done. Pum-pum. Pum-pum. Plastic…plastic. 

Vika: [UI]

Will: When can we put our things? 

Katya: So, material specialist. Saleh…

01:15:30:00

Saleh: Hm? 

Katya: Um…Can you put, please, a drill brand and drill head?

Saleh: I put it already. 

Will: //Can you write?

Katya: Can you put it, because I don’t have. I wrote the drilling method.

Will: Can you write or not? 

Saleh: Point…

Vika: What? What? What? What?

Will: Things. 

Vika: Huh? 

Saleh: Twenty-five forty-one? 

Will: You can write things in your…

Saleh: Kate, which point? 

Oleg: So, what point did we have, at least? 

Katya: Yes. //Twenty-five fourty-one.

Vika: //Say again. What?

Ashley: //We’re still talking about twenty-five forty-one, right? 

Will: I don’t know. Can you write anything there at all or not?

Vika: No, I can’t write anything.

Will: Okay. 

01:16:00:16

Vika: I even… I tried to write in the lines for the hydrogeologist, but nothing happens. I can only click reject….

Ashley: We’re definitely talking about “twenty-five forty-one”, right?

Will: Mhm. 

Ashley: Yes? Okay. 

Oleg: Twenty-five forty-one? 

Ashley: Yes. 

Vika: I can choose the filters, at least. 

Ashley: Okay. So…

Oleg: Okay, these are big.

Ashley: I was able, my things…

Vika: Oh, Lord.

Ashley: Create.

Will: How did you change it? 

01:16:31:00

Ashley: Um…In the Signoff thin my dropdowns are actually working. 

Will: Oh. 

Ashley: Um, thank God. 

Katya: Can I sign off on this decision or not? 

Ashley: Just wait a second, because when you do, everything goes away, so…

Katya: Well, okay. I’ll just wait. 

Oleg: Fifty-six. 

01:17:04:18

Ashley: [UI]

Katya: Hm…

Ashley: Five…

Katya: Who are we waiting for now?

Will: I don’t know what we’re waiting for. 

Katya: Shall we, maybe, approve one after another?

01:17:30:05

Ashley: Okay, so…

Vika: Just approve?

Katya: What are we doing now? 

Oleg: No, wait. Hold on…

Ashley: So…

Vika: Oh, somebody…somebody called the point: “Best is twenty-five forty-one”.

Katya: Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. They chose it. //If it works for all of us…

Vika: //[UI]

Katya: Well, it works for all of us. We’re not going to argue with them now.

Will: Yes, yes, yes. 

Oleg: Yes.

Katya: It does work for all of us.

Will: Okay, let’s all click Signoff status. 

Katya: Let’s do it.

Will: Okay?

01:18:00:20

Will: Sedimentologist 

Vika: Okay. 

Oleg: Okay…[UI]

Ashley: So, you’re signing off?

Will: I can’t do anything. 

Oleg: And, it’s just, for me…

Will: Okay…Martian terrain specialist, structural geologist, sedimentologist…

Vika: It doesn’t want to do it for me. 

Will: Okay. Why is it showing that they are not…

Saleh: [UI]

Vika: [UI]

Ashley: I can’t anymore. 

Oleg: So, what did you click? 

Ashley: Once people start //signing off, you can’t…

Vika: //You just click on yourself.

Saleh: Hm. 

01:18:30:10

Vika: You check it. 

Ashley: I know. 

Vika: Yes. 

Saleh: [UI]

Will: What? 

Oleg: Nothing…oh, there. 

Will: Um…you are the material specialist. 

Katya: Mhm. 

Will: Just do it again. Tap it. //Here we go. Yes. 

Vika: //[UI]

Saleh: But still, I didn’t complete any. 

Will: Yeah, so…Ash, it’s still waiting on you. 

Ashley: I thought I already pressed this. Damn it! 

Will: You probably did. 

01:19:02:10

Will: [SL] Say yes. 

Ashley: I just…

Will: There we go. There we go. There we go. 

Ashley: Yeah? 

Will: Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. 

Oleg: [UI]…When…when is our next assignment? 

Ashley: Relay. So, we’ll have DeChurch…

Katya: //Oh, just a questionnaire.

Oleg: //Will there be questionnaires? 

Ashley: Yes, we’ll have those //Relay task too.

Salah: //DeChurch nine and ten. 

Oleg: There will also be communication, right?

01:19:30:00

Ashley: Remember, when we //communication…messages

Katya: //Messages.

Oleg: //Messages, yes. 

Ashley: Yes. //So, what’s happening? 

Katya: //What did they say? 

Oleg: Because we still have a whole hour

Ashley: Yes.

Oleg: before completion…and…

Saleh: DeChurch? 

Vika: [UI]

Ashley: Yes, but there is still a relay task we have to do after this. 

Saleh: Hm. 

Ashley: Yeah…But according to the instructions it says that DeChurch nine and ten are kind of done throughout this, so…I think it’s right after this first one. 

Vika: How’s your battery? 

01:19:59:09

Vika: Okay? 

Ashley: I’m hungry. Very hungry. 

Katya: It can feel it…chewing.

Oleg: Yes, it is…starting soon. 

Katya: Seven hours? 

Oleg: Turning off…the batteries. 

Ashley: So, is yours, like, kind of in freeze mode right now? 

Will: Yeah, //just give it a minute.

Oleg: //What are we waiting for now?

Will: We are waiting while…

Oleg: For the guys on the other end to accept everything? 

Katya: Damn, why is it taking so long? //They were the ones that chose the point.

Oleg: //For me, nothing…nothing is moving. 

01:20:30:05

Oleg: One thing that…do you remember what depth it was? 

Katya: One thousand…

Vika: The depth of what? 

Katya: Four hundred something. One thousand four hundred and eighty-two, to be exact. 

Oleg: In terms of energy, it was a match.

Vika: It is…not limited…

Katya: What matched? 

Oleg: In terms of energy, it’s very…

Katya: In terms of money, it’s also a match. We’ll be drilling for a long time.

Ashley: So, it, basically says that once we finish the Design task, complete survey DeChurch nine. Do you think we should just start? 

Vika: So…

01:20:59:10

Will: But don’t we gotta…why would we…I mean, do that right now? 

Ashley: It said…I mean, it says that it happens, like, throughout this. So, like, DeChurch ten is after the Relay one. 

Saleh: Okay. Let’s go. 

Ashley: //So, I don’t know. Should we start it? 

Oleg: //Okay, does anyone have anything live at all?

Will: Yeah. I mean, if it says it…

Vika: DeChurch now? Nine? 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Vika: Okay. 

Katya: Right now? 

Saleh: Multiteam task battery.

Will: So, I think this one sucks. 

Ashley: What? 

Will: I think this one sucks.

Saleh: Yeah.

Will: But I could be wrong. 

Ashley: So…

Oleg: Yes.

01:21:31:20

Ashley: Yeah, so, DeChurch nine. Ugh…

Oleg: DeChurch…Okay…

Katya: It’s a beautiful color.

Vika: Mhm. 

Oleg: DeChurch…

01:21:59:15

Oleg: Post…multiteam? Battery, right? 

Ashley: DeChurch nine. So, yeah post multiteam task battery. 

Oleg: There, DeChurch – good job. They translated everything here. 

01:22:32:18

Oleg: Very convenient. And that program part – not so much. 

Katya: You’re a mechanical engineer, Oleg, right? 

Oleg: No, I’m the bio. 

Katya: Bio? //Biochemical? 

Oleg: // Biochemical.

Ashley: //Biochemical. 

Katya: Biochemical. Okay. 

Oleg: Biochemical. 

01:23:04:12

Oleg: For drilling, for [UI]… I wanted to ask a question: What is a [SL] sedimentologist. It’s planetary geology.

Vika: Planetary geology is a group.

Oleg: And a sedimentologist? 

Vika: Hello, Google. Shoot, we don’t have Google. 

Oleg: That means we don’t know. 

01:23:33:00

Katya: Ashley, you are sedimentologist, right?

Saleh: Who is biochemical?

Ashley: No, that’s him.

Vika: Oleg. 

Saleh: You? 

Ashley: I’m the meteorology. 

Katya: Oh, okay. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Saleh: Martian? 

Ashley: Martian meteorology, yeah. 

Oleg: [SL] How much will it be? 

Saleh: Vika?

Vika: Hydrogeologist. 

Ashley: Hydrogeologist. 

Vika: Hydro…

Ashley: Sorry. 

Vika: Thank you. Thank you. 

Saleh: Hydrogeologist. 

Vika: Thank you. 

Ashley: No, I was just clarifying, sorry.

01:24:11:10

Saleh: [SL] It’s written “Sirius”

Oleg: Okay…Okay…one, two, three…Oh! All five! I forgot myself. 

Vika: Oops. 

01:24:34:21 – 01:27:09:21

[no audio]

Oleg: Katya, which one is correct for you: drilling or operation? Drilling, right?

Katya: Drilling, yes, a drilling specialist.

01:27:17:22 – 01:30:52:26

[no audio]

Vika: What? 

Katya: This point was moving around here for me. 

Vika: I see. Hallucinations.

Katya: Look how beautiful it is. 

Vika: Oh, why are you doing this? 

Katya: I just accidentally pressed it with my hand.

Vika: Cool. 

Saleh: Ah, done. 

Katya: Good job.

Vika: Really? 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Katya: //[UI] NASA

Will: //Lucky man. 

Saleh: [UI]

Vika: //We’re NASA.

Oleg: Saleh, are you done? How fast you are, right? How did you do it? Without looking? So …//just put everything in the same spot? 

Saleh: [UI]

01:32:22:22 – 01:32:06:09

[no audio]

Katya: What? 

Vika: What? 

Oleg: You’re done, too? 

Will: Mhm. 

01:32:30:00

Saleh: You’re done, huh? 

Will: Okay…Do we log out of the Project RED? 

Saleh: Me? 

Will: I mean, all of us. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Oleg: [UI]

Will: Relay. 

Saleh: So, what do we have now? 

Will: Now we have Project RED Relay which is another type of task. You’ll see. It’s a lot easier and a lot cooler. 

01:33:03:00

Saleh: Mhm.

Will: I thought it said on the thing to do it after, though. 

Saleh: Which one? 

Will: I thought you said, it says that DeChurch nine…

Saleh: There is DeChurch ten also. 

Will: And ten. But after we do Project RED. 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Will: Whatever. If it says in the directions. 

Saleh: It’s mentioned [UI]

01:33:30:00

Katya: What, did we have it already? 

Vika: Yes, yes. 

Katya: Where are the prompts? I still don’t see the promised prompts.

Vika: What prompts? 

Katya: It says there: “There will be prompts”… “Carefully read the prompt” 

Vika: Maybe, they mean these things. 

Katya: Oh. 

Vika: Can you tell me, on the Signoff page…is something happening for you? 

Will: No.

Ashley: Not yet. 

Saleh: Should we sign off? 

Ashley: [UI]

Will: You already did. 

01:34:00:10

Saleh: Log out, I mean. 

Will: I guess so. Log out. 

Vika: Log out? 

Saleh: I don’t know. 

Will: Unless…//I don’t know. So, what do we have to do to go…

Saleh: //Ashley, we’re waiting for you. 

Ashley: I’m not the //only one still taking…I’m still…I’m still…

Saleh: //Everyone finished. 

Vika: Ash, we have to do…

Ashley: I’m still taking the survey. Give me a second. 

Will: Now, do we go to…

Ashley: We have some time to review the Relay. 

Katya: Oh, my God. I lost the…

Saleh: [UI]

Will: What did you lose? 

Vika: Your questionnaire? 

Katya: I lost Project RED. 

Will: Oh, that’s fine. 

Ashley: I think, it’s, probably, okay. 

01:34:30:09

Vika: Yeah. 

Ashley: I think we’re…

Vika: //Yes, I think so. 

Katya: //Should I open it again, yes? 

Will: Go to Desktop, and then we go to Project RED Relay, but don’t minimize this. 

Katya: Shoot, how do I do it? 

Will: Don’t minimize. You should open…

Saleh: Okay. 

Oleg: Hold on, hold on. 

Saleh: Huh? 

Will: So, open the…

Saleh: Where?

Will: //Open File Explorer.

Saleh: //[UI]

Will: So, open File Explorer.

Saleh: Here? 

Will: Mhm. 

Saleh: Go to your Desktop. 

Vika: Sorry. 

Oleg: //Damn!

Katya: //I didn’t minimize. 

01:35:02:00

Will: Mhm. 

Saleh: [UI]

Will: Go to Project RED Relay.

Vika: Oops. 

Katya: Project RED Design, right? 

Saleh: Design and Relay videos? 

Will: Project RED Relay. Not Project RED Design. 

Saleh: This is what? Oh, okay. 

Vika: Oh. 

Will: Okay. 

Saleh: [SL] Dragon?

Vika: [SL] Oh, huge. 

Saleh: Then? 

Katya: I opened it. 

01:35:29:08

Will: So, choose your… who you are.

Oleg: So, we’re continuing with these here? 

Ashley: Yes.

Katya: I don’t have the third tab. You neither, right? So, are we starting all over again? 

Vika: Let’s find it. What was it? Twenty…forty…

Will: So, now we choose two. Two people //that you’re gonna wanna send messages to. 

Katya: //Twenty-five forty-one. Twenty-five forty-one.

Vika: [UI]

Will: So, we’re opening Relay, when are we finishing? 

Vika: Oh, my previous ones…

Ashley: //I’m still not done here. 

Saleh: //Two people for…huh? 

Vika: It opened the previous points for me.

01:35:59:18

Saleh: So, I have to select two people //just to send them messages? Like in the previous task? 

Ashley: //Good idea.

Will: Yeah, so, we’re gonna get…there’s like…there’s like…no, no, no. There is like a fake email thing, and you just have to forward it to people. You don’t have to read it; you don’t have to do anything with it. You just…

Ashley: But you have to read, like, the topic of it, what it is, so that //you know, like, to who is a better person…

Will: //Yeah, yeah. There is a subject line. You read the subject line, and you forward it to one of the people that you choose. You have to choose two people.

Ashley: [UI]

Saleh: So, anything? Oh. 

Katya: And where is it? Where are we doing it? 

Vika: //Wait, is this Project RED again? 

Ashley: //Well, no. You pick two people in the beginning who you would like to be on your team, basically. 

Katya: //Where? 

Will: //Project RED relay. 

Vika: Oh. 

Will: Okay. Here’s how we do it. 

Ashley: And then they will give you something in your…

Vika: Okay. 

01:36:30:00

Ashley: mailbox, //and, say, like, the topic says “Oh, we need to know about depth of the drill, basically”. And out of the two people that you’ve picked, you pick who you think the best person would be to get that message next. 

Will: //We’ll say, we are doing…Desktop…

Vika: //Yeah. 

Will: //Damn!

Vika: Individual role. Where? No. 

Will: Mhm…Now...

Saleh: Who is mechanical engineer here? 

Ashley: [UI]

Will: It’s showing it. 

Katya: Relay.

Vika: Relay.

Katya: Relay. Mhm. 

Vika: Okay. 

Will: What is this?

Ashley: Yes. //I think we can close it.

Vika: //Project RED Relay. 

Ashley: Yes. 

Will: Could you show him? 

Oleg: Shall I close RED? 

Ashley: Yes. And you can open Project Relay or Project RED Relay. 

Will: Just don’t minimize…//don’t minimize the camera. So, it’s like…

Katya: //Go to Desktop.

Oleg: Well, camera, yes, and here, //Project RED should I close it? 

Ashley: //Project RED you just close, right? 

Vika: To Desktop…

Will: Yes. Close it any way you want.

Ashley: [UI]

Ashley: God! //[UI]

Katya: //Maybe some coffee?

Vika: Right now? Are you sure? Maybe yes.

Oleg: Which one?

Vika: //Maybe after that?

Ashley: [UI]

Vika: To take a break…

Ashley and Saleh: //[UI]

Saleh:  So, this one is easy, yeah?

Ashley: Mhm.

Will: Oh, yeah.

Ashley: [UI]

Will: You’ll see. Don’t worry.

Salah: I didn’t do it the last time.

Will: I’ll walk you through…You’ll see on the left-hand side emails come in. You look at it, then click on it, and it will give you option to forward it to somebody. 

01:41:01:24

Will: //You have to forward it to one of the two people.

Vika: //[UI]

Katya: What’s there?	

Will: Based upon what it says on the title.

Vika: //I was afraid [UI]

Saleh: //In case if the subject is not related. Like, for example…

Will: If it’s not related to anybody in your list, just send it forward because maybe somebody in
your list can send it to somebody it is related to. So, the goal is to keep the inbox empty.

Saleh: Oh, okay.

Vika: Pass it on to everyone.

Will: Pass it on to everyone quickly.

01:41:32:00

Ashley: Oh, thank God! … Done!

Will: Hop right in. Let’s go.

Katya: Who is the hydrogeologist?

Ashley: I see the drilling specialist is sending me a lot of stuff.

Vika: It’s just that I know about your connections, //so I’m sending it to you.

Katya: //I can see the hydrogeologist, sedimentologist…It’s just…

Ashley: //And who is the drilling specialist? Yeah, drilling specialist. You’re giving me a lot.

Katya: Not only to you. She’s given Oleg a lot, too.

Vika: This one is for Oleg. Please pass it on.

Ashley: I think we do.

Oleg: No, there’s a lot there.

Ashley: I think that we’ll do it one more time.

Saleh: Done?

Oleg: One more time?

Ashley: Yes. //We do it one more time, I think.

Will: //Yes, but we’ll see.

Oleg: Are we choosing other pairs now?

Will: Yeah, yes. Hold on, hold on.

Katya: Now, somebody will suffer. The person that forwarded me all the messages.

Will: Somebody will suffer.

Katya: Here you go. There!

Vika: Uh-oh.

Will: I like it when you’re talking like you’re a kid on the block. Like…

Katya: Who are you? Hydrogeologist, yes? 

Vika: No.

Katya: Hydrogeologist, I know.

Vika: No.

Ashley: I should’ve picked you, Katya. Since you’ve sent me so many things.

Katya: [SL] Oh, no!

Ashley: No, I didn’t. I…

01:53:22:00

Katya: Okay, that’s it.

Ashley: Look at your fancy notes.

Katya: Oh my God. That was clever. Wow! I want that, too.

Vika: Clever balls. 

Katya: Damn.

Ashley: You can see on here where…okay.

Will: You made a lot of effort here. We didn’t work that much, so we’re fine.

Vika: Can I just live my life in peace?

01:53:51:10

Will: No, you can’t.

Ashley: Okay.

Vika: What?

Katya: Oh my God!

Will: Oh my God…Cool. Super cool.

Katya: Nobody chose me. You guys are great. 

Will: How do you know that nobody chose you?

Katya: Nobody is writing to me.

Will: Not yet, but you don’t know. Maybe, there will be something later.

Ashley: I’m getting old. My back hurts from just sitting here.

Will: Same, though. 

01:54:22:00

Will: Just a little sit down for two and a half hours, nbd. What do we have after this? 

Ashley: // Another survey, so, DeChurch ten after this one.

Vika: //[UI]

Will: //Two more surveys. 

Vika: Yes, okay. Really? Oh, hello.

01:54:52:00

Will: I wanna be your destination.

Katya: As you work in the first round, so you will rest in the second round.

Will: Yes.

Katya: Nobody chooses you.

Vika: This is for here.

Will: Okay. What are you doing? This? No.

Katya: I want to tidy up here. Don’t…

01:55:25:10

Will: //Katya, please don’t use this thing for it. Seriously?

Vika: //Can I live my life in peace?

Will: You’re spending our resources.

Katya: [SL] Wipe your hand, at least.

Will: Okay... Okay, very cool. How are you? Let’s go have some coffee. Apparently, we don’t have much work to do today.

Katya: We deserve that.

Vika: No!

Katya: Is nobody writing you at all?

Vika: They are.

Katya: Oh, they’re writing to me.

01:55:59:10

Vika: [UI]…Then let’s look.

Will: Science…

Vika: I need these guys, right?

Will: See what you’ve done? So much…now, I need to wait for it to dry.

Katya: It smells nice. Don’t make stuff up. 

01:56:37:05

Katya: So, this time you didn’t choose me? Now you can’t send it, right?

Vika: Okay…Let’s try this here, if…

01:57:01:00

Will: Somebody will suffer…beep-boop… I want them to watch this video, where it’s like: “Hey, hello. This is William Brown”.

01:57:33:00

Vika: [UI]

Will: It’s year 1998 for us.

Vika: Oh, you also have access to us?

Katya: You sent the message around in full circle.

Vika: In full circle.

Katya: Well, that’s true. It keeps circling back to the same people.

01:57:56:20

Ashley: Oh my God! Hydrogeologist, what are you doing to me?

Will: Can you work faster please?

Vika: [SL] Nein.

Saleh: Will…

Oleg: Yes, it’s circling around there…

Saleh: Vika, we are sending messages to Ashley.

01:58:32:00

Ashley: God dang it! Stop!

Vika: Okay… Five minutes?

Will: Cool.

01:59:13:03

Saleh: [SL] That’s it.

Vika: This is for you…

01:59:36:12

Vika: Back to the structural geologist.

Will: Hm?

Vika: Oops.

01:59:59:29

Will: Damn! Structural geologist is receiving fifteen now…

Ashley: I know. He is struggling.

Oleg: Piping system – it is…piping?

Will: Pipes.

Oleg: Pipes.

02:00:30:20

Vika: Beep-beep.

Katya: Boop-boop.

Will: Sewerage.

Katya: Oh, finally there’s a message.

Will: I’ve got a message. At last.

Vika: Structural geologist is snowed under with messages. 

02:01:01:20

Ashley: Okay. 

Vika: The meteorologist, too.

Ashley: [UI]

Oleg: Barabashka went…[UI]

Ashley: This one is going around in circles.

02:01:43:20

Vika: Well, okay.

02:02:14:20

Vika: A minute and a half.

Oleg: Maintenance is just sitting there. Keeping it all to himself.

02:02:48:00

Oleg: The sedimentologist isn’t working either.

Katya: Yes, I’m a sedimentologist.

02:03:25:00

Vika: Is it okay for you?

Oleg: Geologist, what are we waiting for?

Katya: Done. Five, //four, three, two...

Oleg: Two geologists.

Saleh: [SL] He didn’t finish.

Ashley: Last one. What did we get? 

02:03:58:00

Ashley: I like this one.

Will: Good job everybody.

Vika: Yes. [UI]

Ashley: Great job! Okay.

Saleh: Are we done?

Ashley: Well, we have DeChurch ten.

Katya: It was fun.

Oleg: //Do you have unanswered messages left?

Will: //It’s just a survey that we do. 

Ashley: Yeah.

Will: We’re here anyway.

Vika: That a second person //forwarded to me.

Saleh: //DeChurch ten?

Ashley: Yeah. So, let me tell you where you guys need to put your recordings. So, I think we can stop.

Oleg: Are we finishing?

Saleh: [UI]

Oleg: Got it.

Ashley: And don’t minimize…Don’t minimize it. 

Oleg: Mhm. 

Ashley: Don’t minimize it.

Katya: Oh, oh, oh. I have no space. Hold on, just a second. 

Vika: Oopie. 

Will: What do you mean, you have no space?

Vika: And I can delete the previous recording, by the way, right?

Ashley: Continue recording you mean? 

Vika: I mean, yeah, recording. 

Ashley: You continue. 

Vika: The previous, I mean. 

Ashley: Oh, you can get rid of it, yeah, if it’s on…Yeah. 

00:00:30:06

Ashley: But, I mean, it on your thing anyway.

Katya: I’ll delete it now.

Ashley: Okay. So, everyone starts their video…their audio recording too. 

Vika: Yep. 

Ashley: Okay… Okay. So, again, just like last time, you know, when I count to three, we all say “Mark”. 

Vika: Okay. 

Oleg: Do you have the recording? 

Ashley: Yes. I have the recording. 

Oleg: Alright. We got it.

Ashley: Okay. So, everybody has their cameras turned on and your audio device turned on.

00:01:02:00

Ashley: Correct? 

Will: Is your audio on? 

Oleg: [SL] Correct. 

Ashley: Press the…

Saleh: Which one, this? 

Ashley: //Yeah. 

Will: //Yeah. Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. So, everybody should have a red dot. Yes. Okay. So…

Saleh: Video also? 

Ashley: Yes. 

Oleg: The sixteenth. The sixteenth. 

Ashley: And make sure it kind of…Yeah, make sure your face is fully into it. Yeah. 

00:01:30:10

Oleg: The sixteenth.

Ashley: Okay. Okay. So, today is November 16th, 2021. The time is 15:27. It’s mission day twelve. On a count of three: one, two, three. //Mark. 

All: //Mark. 

Ashley: Okay. So, at this point we can begin to establish connection with Martian analysis group. So, we can write to them on the chat. 

00:02:01:01 – 00:04:13:13

[no audio]

Will: What’s happened? 

00:04:16:20 – 00:06:41:27

[no audio]

Oleg: Are they already communicating with us or not? Or…

Will: I haven’t heard anything yet. 

Vika: [UI] …Oops, oops, oops. Please, forgive me.
Saleh: What is it?

Ashley: He’s asking if we’ve received anything from the Chicago team. 

00:07:11:05

Vika: Guys…

Ashley: Mhm. 

Vika: The point number thirty-one four. 

Katya: Thirty-one four?

Vika: Yes. What do you think? 

Saleh: Which point? 

Vika: Thirty-one four.

00:07:45:22

Katya: You haven’t looked yet? 

Vika: We have.

Katya: It doesn’t work, right? 

Vika: It works for me. 

Katya: Is it okay for you? 

Vika: Mhm. 

Katya: Perhaps, thirty-two fifteen works for everyone. 

Oleg: Just keep it as an extra point.

Katya: Well, okay. 

00:08:04:14

Katya: Oh…

Will: Did you say “thirty”, what?	

Vika: Thirty-one four. 

Katya: The depth is great. 

Vika: That’s just wonderful. There’s a lot of water. 

Katya: Well, yes, but we will drill it…

Oleg: Thirty-one four? 

Vika: Yes.

Katya: It’s twice as deep as... the previous point. //Twice as expensive.

Oleg: //Four or fourteen? Vika, is it four or fourteen?

Vika: Four. 

00:08:31:29

Vika: No. 

Katya: Murky.

Oleg: Too murky. 

Katya: Mhm.

Vika: Only forty-four percent. But the rest...there are no impurities at all.

Ashley: But there…it says here that only fifty population is possible.

Oleg: There’s a lot of depth there. 

Ashley: So it wouldn’t be that way for a lot of people. Population reached. 

Vika: [UI]

Katya: That’s for her.

Ashley: For her. 

Vika: Oh. 

00:08:59:20

Oleg: There. And the depth is great. 

Vika: The depth is great – it means a lot of water and, therefore, there will be enough for more people.

Vika: Do you have a lot of people there [UI]? In that same place, if there’s more than necessary, then it’s just [SL] use.

Oleg: So, cloudy impurities…cloudy impurities [UI]

Katya: Saleh, what do you think about thirty-two fifteen point? 

00:09:31:00

Vika: [UI]

Saleh: Hm…[UI]

Ashley: It’s not bad for me. 

Oleg: It’s…

Katya: Not bad? 

Ashley: Not bad. 

Oleg: I…

Will: Which one? 

Katya: Thirty-two fifteen. Thirty-two fifteen. 

Vika: [UI]

Katya: For me is not bad either, just, if it’s for everyone…

Oleg: It’s great for me. For me, just one filter can tackle it. 

00:10:03:05

Will: Okay. 

Oleg: Yes, it’s…It’s just…

Will: Average water loss. It’s just, there’s a lot of water loss. 

Oleg: A lot of water losses, is it high or what?

Will: Yes. It’s, like, we want it closer to zero, and this point is seventy-eight. It means that…[UI]…It just means that we lose a lot of water, in general.

00:10:32:00

Katya: Look, maybe somewhere in this area, but where you will lose less water.

Vika: Yes. I’m looking.

Katya: Something right next to it.

Vika: [UI]

Oleg: The only thing is I don’t know how the robots will climb there. It’s a slope. And, there, for meteorologists. Who is responsible for the location? It’s likely…

00:11:00:00

Katya: Meteorology… Ashley is the meteorological…

Oleg: No. Geologist. 

Katya: Oh, geologist. Hydrogeologist.

Oleg: William is a hydrogeologist.

Will: No, it’s Vika.

Katya: No, it’s Vika. 

Oleg: Oh, you are a sedimentologist. 

Will: Mhm. 

Ashley: Nobody…nobody has received a response yet, right? 

Oleg: No. 

Katya: Mhm

Will: Mh-hm.

Ashley: Me neither. 

Vika: Nope. 

00:11:31:00

Katya: Also, thirty-two thirteen is a good enough point. 

Will: Which one? 

Katya: Thirty-two thirteen. Thirty-two thirteen. …Thirteen. …Thirteen. 

Oleg: Oh, yes! It’s absolutely great.

Katya: We’re looking at thirty-two thirteen.

Vika: Yes, we’re looking [SL] and getting amazed.

Oleg: [UI]

00:12:00:00

Oleg: Rocky terrain. 

Vika: Too little water.

Katya: Too little water? 

Oleg: There’s none there.

Vika: Mhm. 

Oleg: But it’s too accurate…

Saleh: Thirty-two what? 

Katya: Thirteen. 

Ashley: Thirty-two thirteen. 

Katya: Thirty-two…

Vika: In terms of contamination, it’s perfect, but in terms of the size it’s not very good.

Katya: I just have the lowest parameters. That is, you understand, this is the maximum ... that is, it’s just a reference point, which I can at least approve.

Oleg: For me, it’s great…//great.

Vika: //There will be too little water.

00:12:30:00

Will: //Yes, and there will be water loss.

Katya: //Is that minimal or just not enough? It’s just that if we have enough, then…

Vika: It’s, like, very little. 

Oleg: So, there won’t be enough water, right?

Katya: I mean, Vika, we need to find exactly something in the middle, so that for everyone...

Vika: Yes, yes, yes, but it’s less than the average.

Katya: Oh, is it less than the average? 

Vika: Yes. 

Katya: Okay. It’s just the lowest point for me. All the indicators of the lowest point.

Ashley: //For me, it’s still not a very big difference between fifteen and thirteen.

Vika: //The previous one, too. 

Katya: Hm…

00:13:02:00

Vika: Fifteen is better for me.

Saleh: Thirty-two fifteen, I think. 

Ashley: Is better? 

Saleh: Is better. 

Will: Fifteen is better. Which one? 

Saleh: Thirty-two fifteen. 

Vika: So far, it’s the best point.

Katya: So, it’s thirty-two fifteen, right? 

Vika: Yes, it seems so. 

Will: Well, it looks that way. 

Saleh: Any information you have, guys? 

Vika; Oh, la, la. Oh, I have it. Thirty-two fifteen. I’m looking at what a beautiful point it is. 

Katya: So, thirty-two fifteen doesn’t work only for William, right?

Vika: Well…

Katya: We lose a lot of water.

Will: I’ll look again. [UI]. Okay, it’s okay. 

00:13:32:00

Will: [SL] Which one…

Oleg: Saleh, which one did you want? 

Saleh: Thirty-two fifteen. 

Will: [UI]. Okay, not bad. 

Saleh: Thirty-two? 

Katya: Fifteen, yes.

Will: [UI]

Oleg: Oh, well, this //at the very beginning, we...

Saleh: //Fifteen.

Katya: We’re talking about it, yes, as…

Oleg: For me, it’s ideal. 

Will: Fifteen seems okay. Thirty-two fifteen.

Ashley: What do you think of forty eighteen? 

00:14:00:00

Katya: Let me take a look. 

Oleg: Forty eighteen? Hold on. 

Vika: Just a second. I think I’ve found something…[UI]

Katya: [whispering] [UI]

Vika: Okay, forty eighteen? 

Oleg: Um…

Katya: Hm…

Oleg: I’m all for it. 

Katya: Well, it’s very expensive. Well, it’s very expensive. 

Oleg: Well, the deposits here are not too deep, large rocks. For me, it’s totally awesome.

00:14:31:00

Ashley: Not great?

Oleg: Good. 

Ashley: Okay. Forty eighteen? 

Oleg: Um-m…

Ashley: Or not? 

Oleg: It’s…hold on.

Katya: Saleh.

Saleh: Depth of water - one thousand three hundred forty-four. 

Oleg: Just a second, hold on.

Saleh: It’s…

Oleg: Oh, there.

Will: Forty…

Katya: It’s too expensive. 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Will: Which one? //What’s the number? 

Katya: //It’s too much. 

Vika: //It’s okay. 

Ashley: Forty eighteen. 

Vika: Oh, forty eighteen? 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Vika: Thirty-one twenty-one. Oh…

Katya: No. Forty eighteen.

Vika: Why? //Where is it from? What is this?

Oleg: //Forty eighteen. The only thing is that the pumps ... it’s deep here.

Saleh: //[UI] water depth

00:15:01:00

Will: Water depth? 

Saleh: Did you see it? 

Oleg: One thousand three hundred and forty-four meters.

Will: //Yes, I see. Yeah. 

Ashley: //Oh, so it’s too…

Katya: For me it’s very good, because more water…

Ashley: Too deep. 

Oleg: Yes, //but given the fact that it’s clean water.

Ashley: //Uh-uh. Okay. 

Katya: //and for us it’s bad because it’s too much…

Oleg: Less filtering. It works. 

Katya: My…

Vika: Okay, I’ll now say for myself.

Ashley: Um. Accessibility… [UI]

Will: It’s a good size. 

Vika: Um…

Oleg: [UI]

Ashley: Accessibility…

Vika: The output won’t be super strong. The water output.

00:15:32:23

Oleg: Large…Okay, forty…

Ashley: Because in this place the accessibility for us is very good and the climate there also looks very good.

Will: Which one is that? 

Ashley: And…forty eighteen. And also in this place seven thousand people can survive...

00:16:02:00

Ashley: get access to this place.

Katya: Forty eighteen. 

Ashley: Team signoff phase has begun.

Oleg: Yes, yes. 

Katya: What is this?

Ashley: What is it? 

Saleh: Why? 

Will: Okay. Alright. Cause it’ll just be like that sometimes. 

Katya: Is that it? Is our time up? 

Will: Alright, so, what are we going with? What number do we choose? Forty-eight fifteen? Thirty…

Oleg: Or…or…

Ashley: Or thirty-two…

Saleh: Wait. What happened now? Where //is the map? 

Oleg: //If…

00:16:30:00

Will: So, it kicked us…it’s still in one of those tabs here but it kicked us over to the team signoff. 

Ashley: But why is the chat not working? 

Will: It may be working. It may not just be on. Maybe this is just for us. We don’t know. But we’re not getting anything from them, so we gotta move on. 

Ashley: Okay. //So, what do you guys think? 

Will: //Okay, now…

Ashley: Thirty-two fifteen or forty eighteen?

Katya: For me, forty-two fifteen – it’s two hundred and forty one hours of work. Forty eighteen – it’s three hundred and five hours of work. A small difference, but the difference is only in the cost.

00:16:59:20

Katya: The cost is almost twice as high. It’s better…

Will: Which one do you choose? 

Katya: Of course, I would choose thirty-two fifteen, but //forty-eighteen is also fine, if it’s better for everyone, then we’ll choose that one.

Will: //Thirty-five fif…thirty-two fifteen…

Oleg: Hm…

Will: Thirty-two fifteen but…

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: But forty eighteen is okay. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: What are you taking? 

Ashley: Um…Yeah, I’m sorry. Let me just…

Will: Okay. Which one do you choose? 

Oleg: I have thirty-two fifteen…

Will: Is thirty-two fifteen okay? 

Oleg: Yes.

Will: What are you taking? 

Vika: Thirty-two fifteen and forty-eighteen work for me.

Will: Thirty-two fifteen? Also works, right? 

00:17:30:00

Katya: Which one is better? 

Vika: Forty eighteen.

Katya: Oh, it doesn’t matter, right? 

Will: Which one are you thinking? 

Ashley: //You said “not important” or…

Saleh: //Thirty-two fifteen? 

Katya: The same.

Will: Thirty-two fifteen. 

Vika: They are about…

Ashley: Alright, that’s fine with me. 

Will: Okay, then, thirty…thirty-two fifteen. 

Ashley: Wait. I got here a response from Martian terrain specialist. 6:40 AM Chicago time. 

Will: What are they saying? 

Ashley: They just said, you know, “We’re here”. Uh, so…We…receive…[UI]

00:18:00:20

Oleg: Oh, they’ve established contact, right?

Katya: So, which one do we choose? Thirty-two fifteen? Which point? 

Ashley: [UI]

Katya: We choose thirty-two fifteen, right? 

Oleg: Well, yes for now. 

00:18:30:00

-

00:19:00:05

Vika: Now we are in our... in our group, yes, geologists?

Ashley: Yeah, so, for now I’m talking with my specific team. 

Will: Me too. I just said: “Hey, good morning. Good to see you. It just kicked us over to the signoff phase. Does it sound right to y’all? I’m writing this at 15:44 Moscow time. Let me know when you receive the shutdown time”

Ashley: Yes. That’s basically along the lines of what I wrote to my team. 

Will: Okay cool. 

00:19:32:10

Oleg: Name [SL] and the rest you didn’t close?

Ashley: Say again. 

Oleg: Name there.

Ashley: Here? 

Oleg: Yes. Yes.

Ashley: On this side? I haven’t done this yet. Um, I...

Oleg: And now you…

Ashley: I’m waiting. I’m talking to my team here, and I told them that we’re here together saying “thirty-two fifteen”.

00:20:00:00

Saleh: Now we will go for that point? //Thirty-two fifteen? 

Ashley: //And I’m waiting for their response. 

Oleg: Yes.

Will: I think so. 

Ashley: Because they’re also…

Will: Who can touch this Map cell? 

Vika: I can. Just select the tab at the top.

Oleg: So, they’ve started to answer me, too.

Ashley: So weird. 

00:20:30:00

Ashley: It looks like they are looking at thirty-two fifteen.

Saleh: Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. So, that’s good. 

Saleh: They are checking it now. 

Ashley: Sorry? 

Saleh: They are checking now. Checking…

00:21:00:00

Katya: Well, okay. Ours has responded, too.

Will: Chop! Hiya! 

Vika: Let’s get some meat. 

Will: Okay. How…how do I click?

Vika: Confirm this.

Will: Yes. I only see “minus one, minus one”.

Vika: Yes, me too.

Ashley: I think somebody else has to enter it, like…

Will: Yeah, that’s what I thought. 

Ashley: Like the operations person or something. 

Katya: [SL] How did you enlarge everything? 

00:21:34:00

Katya: Damn, I…something has happened to my page. 

Oleg: Oh, they wrote //that they are just starting.

Vika: //I don’t have anything at all...I can’t write anything at all. Okay. 

Oleg: And, it’s 6:42 now? Early in the morning? 

00:21:59:10

Will: Well, it’s six forty-seven now.

Katya: William, I’m sorry, you don’t know how, so... Well, it got enlarged for me.

Will: Yes. 

Katya: How can I reduce it? Because…

00:22:34:20

Vika: Yes. It happens. 

Ashley: Alright, I should probably stop writing. Give them a chance to respond. 

Vika: Nein! 

00:22:59:00

Will: [SL] Hello, can you call me Big Sedimentologist? 

Ashley: What? 

Will: What? Okay, yeah. So, I’ve got…we got response from structural geologist. 

Vika: Yep. 

Katya: Oh, cool. 

Will: And operation specialist, but nothing since I responded. So, I don’t know what the delay is. If there is a delay or what? 

Saleh: Hm. 

Ashley: Oh, it’s early morning over there.

Will: A bunch of undergrads. 

Ashley: I mean I would just be waking up and barely functioning at that time, so…

00:23:37:00

Will: Time to party up. You already know what time it is… Morning time. 

Saleh: This delay is good for making tea, you know. 

Will: You want tea? You want tea really bad? I’ll get you your tea soon.

Ashley: No. 

Will: More like, “No”. 

Vika: Be professional. 

00:24:00:10

Will: Tea can be professional. 

Oleg: Katya, so…

Katya: Hm? 

Oleg: It’s for me... I sent the photos taken today

Katya: Mhm. 

Oleg: about mushrooms. 

Katya: Yes, yes, yes.

Oleg: There. And now, apparently, it’s reached the director. He said: “Urgently send off!”

Katya: Ah! Oh. Mushrooms, right? ...Well, what did you manage to, yes, take a picture of?

Oleg: Yes. In short, they weren’t allowed to grow everything.

Vika: Too bad, but still, we can…

00:24:33:00

Vika: Oh la-la. //I think I’ve found another one...another one...

Oleg: //[UI]

Will: //Okay. 

Oleg: Point?

Will: Yeah. 

Vika: Point. Forty twenty-seven. 

Ashley: Forty …

Will: Have they added forty twenty-seven?

Vika: No. I’ve only just found it.

Will: Forty twenty-seven.

Vika: It’s a pretty one. 

Katya: So, [SL] drilling site…

Ashley: Hm…

Vika: Nope. Alright. 

Will: No? 

Ashley: Two red zones for me in this spot.

00:25:00:10

Vika: Okay, so temperature is sixty. It’s so much. 

Oleg: Very deep. But it’s water-bearing, right, for you?

Ashley: Sorry. Say again. Sorry. 

Vika: So, temperature is sixty. 

Saleh: Where? 

Vika: It’s so much. Forty twenty-six. 

Will: Damn…

Saleh: //Forty? 

Vika: //Yeah.

Saleh: //Twenty-six?

Vika: //Yeah. 

Will: //What are you doing? You’re ruining my life.

Ashley: Twenty-six. 

Will: Mhm…

00:25:31:00

Will: There is a decent amount of water there. High water loss, though. That’s not good. 

Vika: Are you talking about forty twenty-six? 

Ashley: So, my messages are kind of //being delayed it seems. 

Will: //Forty twenty-seven. Yeah, I think we’re all being delayed. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Will: Okay. They just came in. “Kind slow we’re finding there. 6:48 local time…”. Okay. So, that…it looks like we’re on a three-minute delay…

00:26:00:00

Will: out, three-minute delay back. So, six-minute turnaround time. See, if it’s 6:40…okay. 

Ashley: That’s right. 

Will: Okay. 

Vika: Oh, they’ve responded to us.

Katya: Okay. [UI]

Will: “Looks like there is three-minute delay. [UI]”

00:26:33:00

Will: Okay. Okay. …[UI]

Vika: Oh. 

Oleg: Please answer the questions. 

00:29:13:20

Ashley: I got a reply from one... one person on my team said “thirty-two fifteen” is too expensive... from the maintenance perspective. 

Saleh: Translate. 

Katya: Our…

Ashley: My maintenance specialist from my team is saying that “thirty-two fifteen” is a little bit expensive for …from a maintenance perspective. 

Will: From the geology team…yeah, that’s…they confirmed that it was okay for most of the geology team it seems to be okay but, yeah, they’re confirming that they were getting some pushback on that. So, they are checking out some different areas. 

00:29:52:00

Katya: And we have an answer about…from our operations specialist. He said that “Our terrain specialist said “It won’t support enough people…enough people. Only six hundred”. Any other ideas?”. And he said that he’s, like…

Oleg: Let’s then, we will...

Katya: It’s seven in the morning, for them. 

Will: And we’re not...we’re not thinking about Signoff right now. They said it didn’t matter. So, we’re not worried about signoff anything. They just said to go ahead and… keep working. 

Ashley: And... from my team, they also said that “forty eighteen” practically doesn’t work,

00:30:29:00

Ashley: because…quantity of water…//there’s practically no water there.

Katya: //Quantity of water. 

Will: //Yes, there’s none there. There’s no water there. There’s none there. 

Oleg: And regarding “thirty-two fifteen”, it’s too expensive, right?

Ashley: Yes. Too expensive, yes. Expensive, yes.

Oleg: Well, we’ll find something now. 

Ashley: Oh, so, basically…And also, “forty eighteen” for my team, they say, basically, doesn’t work because the amount of water there is, basically, zero. 

Saleh: Mhm. 

Ashley: And they are looking at some potentially other locations now. 

00:31:08:00

Oleg: Look, please, five forty-eight.

Will: Zero-five forty-eight, right? 

Oleg: Zero-five forty-eight... It seems to me... Well, for me, it’s just ideal.

Will: Mhm.

00:31:34:10

Will: //There’s no…there’s no water there.

Ashley: //Tell me that one more time.

Oleg: Zero-five forty-eight. Right?

Ashley: Zero-five? 

Will: Yes, but apparently there is no water there. 

Ashley: //Forty-eight.

Katya: //But for me, Oleg, it’s simply the best decision of my life. 

Will: Yes, but if there’s no water there. 

Ashley: So…

Katya: No water, right? //But the ground is so wonderful. 

Ashley: //Zero point five or...

Vika: Wait, somewhere I found...

Katya: //It’s just great.

Will: //You want to make a hole, and there is zero amount of available water. 

Ashley: Five forty-eight.

Katya: Yes, if we do…

Will: And you see that there’s no water there, right?

00:31:59:00

Vika: Yes, I’m looking now. 

Ashley: Oh, where is it? 

Katya: The ground //is so good. [UI]

Ashley: //Oh!

Will: //Five forty-eight? 

Vika: Yes, yes. There’s very little water and too small…

Ashley: It’s too bad for me. There are six red zones, seven orange…

Katya: Mhm. 

Will: There’s no water there, so it doesn’t matter. 

Vika: The water basin is very small.

Ashley: Is there no water there? 

Will: There is no water. 

Vika: //Only...only...only surface water.

Ashley: //There’s no water at all either, so... none.

Oleg: //Yes. 

Vika: And //it will be very…very bad…there will be water running away and there will be a bad water output.

Ashley: //Sorry. 

00:32:37:10

Katya: Eight forty-eight is the same, right?

Oleg: We haven’t considered eight forty-eight yet.

Katya: Look. Maybe…

Oleg: So, eight forty-eight…

00:33:03:15

Oleg: Mh-hm. 

Katya: Hm? 

Oleg: Very muddy and dirty... But if there’s no alternative, we can. That is, it doesn’t run out ... Although, the temperature for extraction there is very comfortable – twenty-four degrees.

00:33:31:15

Katya: Which one? Eight forty-eight, right? 

Will: Let’s do, thirty… thirty thirty-nine. 

Katya: Thirty thirty-nine.

Oleg: Thirty thirty-nine.

Katya: Thirty-nine…

Ashley: Who is the type…the person that can say the amount of water that’s available in that area? 

Will: Me. 

Ashley: You? 

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Will: So, in this area there is eighty-eight thousand…

Oleg: Oh, no!

Vika: It doesn’t work. It doesn’t work.

Will: No? 

Ashley: Hm…

Will: Okay.

Oleg: Too muddy and //dirty water.

Saleh: //What is it? The number? 

Ashley: The climate is really bad, so...

Katya: //Thirty thirty-nine. 

Will: //Thirty thirty-nine. Okay. 

00:34:01:00

Ashley: Not good. 

Vika: Thirty thirty-nine? 

Will: Yeah. //It doesn’t work.

Katya: //It doesn't work for her. You don’t need to look. 

Will: Okay, and twenty-two thirty-eight. 

Ashley: Twenty-two thirty-eight. 

Oleg: Yes…

Saleh: Twenty-two…

Will: Twenty-two thirty-eight. 

Katya: Hm. //[UI]

Ashley: //Not very good for me either. 

Will: Not very good? 

Vika: Not at all. 

00:34:30:20

Will: Not at all? 

Vika: Mhm. 

Ashley: How do you say “orange” in Russian? 

Will: Orange.

Ashley: Oh. 

Vika: And there isn’t that much water there. 

Oleg: The water is very murky there…

Will: There? In twenty-two thirty-eight? 

Vika: Yes.

Oleg: Yes. 

Will: What do you mean? There are one hundred and sixty-two thousand. 

Vika: //There, the depth of the water basin is six hundred and twenty-seven, which means that...

Ashley: //Twenty-two thirty-eight…has a lot of orange, yellow and red zones. 

Will: What?

Saleh: //Who is responsible to select?

Vika: //The water output will be bad. 

Will: Oh, yes. But there’s water there. 

Oleg: //But there it’s very…

Saleh: //Who is responsible to select the point? 

00:35:00:20

Will: There’s water you can’t use //[UI]

Ashley: //I think, any of us right now can suggest to them, like, a point. Um…

Oleg: //Yes, it’s dirty. 

Will: [SL] Ten thousand. 

Ashley: But…and once we, as a team, agree then they…then we relay that to others. 

Katya: What is our main task? To find a place with some water?

Will: //[SL] Download and win.

Oleg: //Agree with everyone that we have...

Katya: No. It’s clear that we won’t find the ideal place, for sure. We must pursue, it turns out, the main common goal. To find water, in general.

Vika: We didn’t like the first point solely because of the high cost, right?

Oleg: Well, Ashley didn’t like it.

00:35:30:10

Vika: The one that’s…thirty-two fifteen.

Oleg: Ash.

Ashley: Say again. 

Oleg: That’s too expensive, right?

Ashley: Thirty-two fifteen?

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: Yes. They…they…on my team, they said it was expensive. Expensive.

Will: And thirty…

Ashley: But…

Will: Eighteen? 

Oleg: Thirty eighteen? 

Will: Thirty eighteen. 

00:36:04:00

Oleg: Thirty eighteen… Well, that’s... Oops... It's both mineral and muddy.

Vika: I don’t like the size of the water basin.

Oleg: Very dirty water. 

Will: What do you mean? 

Vika: In terms of the size…

Saleh: What’s the last point? 

Vika: In terms of the size of limited…

Saleh: Huh? 

Will: Well, a small one, yes. 

Saleh: Guys. 

Vika: Hm? 

Saleh: The last point?

Will: Thirty eighteen. 

00:36:30:00

Will: But it doesn’t look good. 

Saleh: Thirty-one forty-four. 

Ashley: Thirty-one forty-four? 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Will: I’m just looking for water now. Twenty-four thirty-three. Twenty-four thirty-three. 

Ashley: Let me look at Saleh’s first. 

Will: Okay. They are telling us “Twenty-five forty-one”. 

Oleg: Oops, damn.

Will: Twenty-five…

00:37:00:00

-

00:37:26:15

Vika: What is this?

00:38:05:15

Vika: Twenty-four thirty-three – there’s a lot of mineral contamination. It’s very bad.

Will: Twenty-five forty-one? 

Vika: Hm? 

Will: Twenty-five forty-one? 

Ashley: [UI]

Katya: What point are you talking about? 

Will: Twenty-five…

Vika: We had twenty-four…

Saleh: What is it? 

Will: They suggested twenty-five forty-one. 

Vika: Okay. 

Katya: [UI]

Will: Hm…Hm…small, but… Although…

00:38:31:10

Vika: It’s okay.

Will: It’s okay. 

Vika: It’s okay. //I like it. 

Oleg: //Say again.

Katya: Oops, oops, oops.

Will: Okay. //Okay. Twenty-five forty-one.

Katya: //No. Not very much.

Vika: No? 

Oleg: Twenty-five…

Will: Twenty-five forty-one. 

Oleg: Forty-one.

Will: Twenty-five forty-one? 

Oleg: Twenty-five…

Will: It’s okay for us. How does twenty-five forty-one look like for you? 

Ashley: If they would stop putting questions on my screen…

Will: Oh, yeah. 

Ashley: Sorry. 

Will: I think there’s six in total, so…

Oleg: It’s awesome. It’s just ideal.

Will: Awesome. Good.

Oleg: It’s…

Saleh: It’s too deep…What do you think, Kate? 

00:39:00:00

Katya: The same, I think. 

Saleh: Hm.

Ashley: Too deep? 

Saleh: Too deep? 

Ashley: Alright, so, what was the…//what was the number again? I’m sorry. 

Saleh: //So…and for you, I think, it’s good but for us it would be…this is…

Ashley: Repeat the number, please.

Saleh: Too expensive. 

Will: //Let me tell them that. 

Oleg: //Twenty-five…

Vika: //Twenty-five forty-one. Twenty-five forty-one. 

Katya: Saleh, for me was, like…interesting information that thirty-two fifteen is very expensive, because it is the most cheapest point we have before. 

Saleh: Hm. 

00:39:30:00

Katya: And they sent a message to //Ashley that it’s…

Saleh: //Ashley, yeah…expensive for the maintenance. 

Katya: Yes. So, if, like, six hundred is very expensive…I mean depth. 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Katya: What about one thousand and forty…four hundred? 

Saleh: Hm. 

00:40:10:10

Saleh: Look for thirty-one forty-four. 

Katya: A moment…Operation specialist sent me a message about point two and eight. 

Will: Zero two zero eight? 

Katya: Yeah. [SL] Maybe. 

00:40:31:10

Katya: [SL] Where is it? 

Will: Okay. Looks okay from my end. 

Vika: It’s okay. 

Katya: Yeah? 

Will: Yeah. 

Saleh: Which one? 

Ashley: Which one? 

Vika: Um…

Katya: Two eight. 

Will: Two eight. 

Vika: But //it’s a bit muddy.

Ashley: //Two eight? 

Will: Yeah. 

Vika: So, we have…//we have the best points.

Ashley: //Wow. Two? 

Oleg: So…

Will: What? 

Katya: //Two eight.

Vika: //The previous points…

Oleg: Two eight? 

Vika: were better. //Twenty-five forty-one and thirty-two fifteen.

Will: //Yes, but it doesn’t work for them.

Katya: It costs three times more to build there.

00:41:02:00

Will: If it works, then it works.

Saleh: Depth is mediocre. 

Will: Oh, but it’s the average water loss of one. 

Oleg: It’s too muddy there. Although, it is cloudy, but not much. The depth is not great. // How much do you have there?

Saleh: //Is there anything wrong with the point? 

Will: There is some water loss. 

Vika: Well, it concerns me that the depth is small.

Saleh: How is it? Huh? 

Will: Huh? 

Saleh: What is the…

Will: It says there is a complete water loss, but it also says that it’s got a lot of water available, //so I don’t know.

Saleh: //Where? Where? 

Will: Right here. 

Ashley: [UI]

00:41:31:00

Saleh: Average water loss. Okay. 

Will: Yeah. Yes, it doesn’t work because we lose all the water.

Oleg: What is it there? 

Will: A whole lot of water.

Saleh: [UI]

Oleg: And, in general, where can settlements be located?

Will: Huh?

Oleg: Who has information about where the settlements can be located?

Katya: The human factors experts have this one.

Vika: Oh. 

00:42:01:00

Oleg: Where is it better for them? Because it’s transportation. Someone has to think about it.

Katya: [UI]

Oleg: Oh, here – human. 

Katya: [UI]

00:42:30:00

-

00:42:59:20

Will: So... I told them that at “zero-two zero-eight” we will lose all the water.

Oleg: Zero-two zero-eight – what is it? 

Will: It was that…

Vika: The last point.

Will: The last point.

Oleg: Oh. 

00:43:30:20

Katya: [UI]

-

00:44:00:00

-

00:44:33:00

Will: Hm. 

Katya: Hm.

Will: Four eighteen. What does it look like? Four eighteen. 

Saleh: [UI]

00:45:01:10

Will: Probably, it’s too deep, right? What do you think? 

Katya: Four eighteen? Wait a second. 

Oleg: Say again, what was that? 

Will: Four eighteen. 

Oleg: Four eighteen.

Katya: Four eighteen. 

Vika: Mineral pollution will ruin the equipment.  

Katya: Twice as deep as…

Oleg: No, it’s muddy. The mineral levels are at zero there. 

Will: Oh…

Vika: Mineral.

Oleg: Oh, hold on, hold on. 

Will: //One lower. 

Vika: //Four eighteen. 

00:45:30:10

Will: Four seventeen? Are you looking at four seventeen? 

Vika: Four eighteen.

Will: Oh, four eighteen.

Oleg: Oh, yes. It’s mineral, too.

Ashley: Four eighteen is not bad.

Vika: But it’s bad for the equipment...But not super critical, on the other hand. Um…

Oleg: [UI]. //I have thirty-five...mineral.	

Ashley: //Population reached is, like, four times as high as some of the other locations, which is great. 

Saleh: //[UI]

Ashley: And there is, really, only two orange zones that are negative, so we can deal with that with training if the costs don’t have to go towards anything else.

Vika: //I don’t really like the size of the water basin.

00:46:05:25

Ashley: I’m okay with four eighteen. And is there a lot…there is a lot of water there? 

Vika: Nope. 

Will: There is…there is not a lot, but there is…there is…it’s…it’s…it’s like…there is, like…you can get at a larger portion of it. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Oleg: Well, if it’s just mineral, I can remove the mineral.

00:46:30:15

Vika: Are you removing the mineral ones?

Oleg: Yes. 

Vika: Oh. Well…

Oleg: And, in principle, the value is not so great.

Vika: But I don’t like the size of these water basins. Size of [SL] UCA

Oleg: Are they big? 

Vika: No. They’re small. 

Oleg: So…

00:47:02:00

Oleg: [UI]…[PH] Well…well…well…well…They aren’t writing for some reason. They are sleeping. Are they writing to you? 

Katya: Yes. 

00:47:30:00

Katya: Mine are seriously considering two and eight. And another specialist wrote to me… now I’ll tell you… from the space human factor. It’s yours, Ashley. He asked me about point two eight, and I sent him the individual information. And... now, let’s see.

00:48:17:20

Saleh: Did you see the…two point eight? 

Will: [SL] Where? 

Saleh: The question.

Katya: Question? What question? 

Saleh: Yeah, what they are asking. 

Katya: What are they asking? 

Ashley: Yeah. They told me to look at two eight also. Have you…have you all looked at two point eight yet? //Two eight. Two eight, yes.

Oleg: //Yes. Two eight. Yes, hold on...

Saleh: For drilling method you have…

Katya: Yes. I sent him “percussion jetting drilling method. 

00:48:47:04

Saleh: Which one? The last one? Percussion jetting, yeah? 

Katya: Mhm. 

Saleh: Most complex…//[UI]

Oleg: //Well, basically...so, thirty-two. These are cloudy impurities... You can remove it. It works for me.

Will: Which one? 

Oleg: Two eighteen...two eight...Insignificant...

00:49:17:10

Will: This doesn’t work for me.

Ashley: No?

Katya: Absolutely not? //Or, maybe, not ideal? 

Will: //We have 100% water loss.

Vika: Oh. 

Will: Yes.

Ashley: Losses? 

Katya: So, two eight is definitely not an option, right? 

Will: Loss.

Ashley: Oh. 

Will: 100% of water is lost. 

Ashley: Oh. 

Will: In the system. 

Katya: Two eight – definitely not, right, William?

Will: Yes. Definitely not.

Ashley: Did you…

Katya: [sighs]. You can write to the materials… to our specialist…

Oleg: We have fifteen minutes to make a…

Saleh: [UI]

Oleg: decision.

00:49:48:10

Ashley: So, you said that…sorry, you said “two eight” //you lose all of the water. 

Will: //Yes, yes, yes. He has written. Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. 

00:50:22:15

Katya: Have we looked at thirty-seven twenty-six?

Ashley: Thirty-seven twenty-six.

Katya: It’s some new point. 

Katya: [SL] Thirty-six. 	

Will: Hm…

Ashley: Not bad.

Will: It seems…a small one, but it works. Although…

00:50:55:00

Will: It’s okay.

Vika: What point is that? 

Katya: Thirty-seven twenty-six.

Oleg: Okay, thirty-seven twenty-six.

Vika: Hm-mhm.

Ashley: No? 

Katya: No? 

Vika: No. 

Oleg: Oh, well!

Katya: Not at all? 

Vika: Not at all.

00:51:29:00

Oleg: It’s polluted in all the aspects. Actually, the water is very bad.

Will: Which one? Thirty-seven twenty-six – no?

Katya: Don’t even check. It still doesn’t work for anyone.

Ashley: Well, you...you chose “thirty-two fifteen” first, right?

Oleg: Yes.

Katya: But they didn’t like it. The people on the ground didn’t like it.

Ashley: On the ground? 

Oleg: Expensive. 

Ashley: Yes, but I can ask if it’s so expensive that we can’t use it.

Katya: If there are no other options.

Ashley: They said…

00:51:59:00

Ashley: I think we only have ten minutes left.

Oleg: Yes. 

Ashley: Hm… Will, in terms of the water… that’s the most important thing.

00:52:30:10

Ashley: Or a hydrogeologist.

Katya: Mhm. 

Will: What? Which one? 

Ashley: Actually, there’s this…there’s an area there, so that it’s generally okay…maybe, get… 

Will: I mean, it’s…I don’t know.

Ashley: Where is the part that says about…

Will: The…nothing that we haven’t already thrown out. 

Saleh: Kate, did you see the chat? 

00:52:59:20

Katya: Yes, but I don’t have a message. 

Saleh: And…robotics.

Katya: Oh, robotics. 

Oleg: There, they suggested… zero-six forty-one.

Katya: Hold on. 

Oleg: Who suggested it? It’s the mechanic.

Vika: Check nineteen two, please… What else did you say, Oleg? //Six forty-one.

Oleg: //Six forty-one. 

Ashley: Is anyone on Space Robotics here? You’re on Space Robotics, right? 

00:53:30:10

Saleh: Both of us.

Ashley: Are you both Space…Space robotics? 

Katya: Yes. 

Ashley: Um…

Katya: Damn, which one did you say we should check? Nine and two? 

Vika: Six forty-one. 

Katya: Six forty-one?

Ashley: Do you know if the parts…// the parts you will be using, will it be internal or local or specialized? 

Will: //There’s no water. There’s no water. 

Katya: What are you talking about? 

Ashley: What materials or parts will you be using?

Katya: It’s important for us… for me… what kind of ground, depth and…

Vika: Nineteen two. 

Katya: I’ll say now what else. 

00:54:03:05

Will: Twenty…twenty //four…

Katya: //Type of ground, depth and what…

Vika: Fourteen, yes? 

Will: Fourteen, yes. 

Katya: What part, yes.

Ashley: And what part.

Katya: Yes. For me, it gives me...

Oleg: Forty-two fourteen, right? 

Katya: Relevance.

Vika: Twenty-four fourteen.

Katya: I have from 0.5 to one. I mean, I’m not looking either. But there weren’t more than six or eight now, so...

Oleg: So…

Katya: There’s a slight difference between the points in terms of the last factor.

00:54:30:10

Oleg: Hm…

Will: Twenty-four fourteen? 

Oleg: Yes.

Will: For you? It works for me. Vika? 

Vika: I’m looking now. Yes, it’s possible.

Will: Okay. //So, we’ve got half the crew. Half.

Katya: //Which one, say again? 

Ashley: //Wait, what was it? 

Will: Twenty //four fourteen.

Oleg: //four fourteen. Absolutely awesome.

Ashley: Twenty-four fourteen? 

Will: Yeah. 

Oleg: Small inclusions, clean water.

Will: Twenty-four fourteen. [UI]

Oleg: Does it work for you, too? 

Ashley: It’s possible. 

00:55:02:00

Katya: It’s just the borderline.

Will: Borderline? 

Katya: Possible, possible. What about you, Saleh? 

Saleh: Um…it’s okay. This one. 

Oleg: Okay? 

Vika: //Twenty-four fourteen? 

Ashley: //Not the best, but possible. 

Saleh: For depth, the water depth for us is okay. 

00:55:28:00

Katya: I need all info from drilling to us. Okay…Two and eight. Just a second. Two and eight. 

00:55:58:00

Will: Okay, so, twenty-four fourteen is…

Oleg: Wow! Mechanical engineer. So…[UI]

Ashley: Man, two eight really didn’t work for you, huh? //They are stuck on that. 

Will: //For me? It’s so weird, cause it’s, like…

00:56:29:00

Will: I mean, average water loss. So, due to the permeation of the values zero to one, it’s one. 

Ashley: Really? 

Will: Yeah. 

Saleh: Which one? This one? 

Will: This is the average water loss of the…of the thing, so, like. 

Ashley: Is that of the system? //Like, it loses that much water when it’s trying to pump it? 

Oleg: //Wattage…wattage – what is this? Wattage. 

Will: It’s…no, it’s from the…

00:56:53:00

Will: //it’s…the recharge loss and [SL] intrasorurceful loss. The average amount of water that is inaccessible due to the permeation of the hydraulic…can follow…hydraulic [SL] confining bed layers. This is a combination of recharge loss. So, how much is coming in and it’s losing on the way in and how much it is losing in between. If it’s one, I mean, it loses…

Oleg: //Vika, wattage – what is it? 

Vika: //I don’t know what wattage is. 

Oleg: //Wattage…wattage…Does it use three hundred wattage or three hundred…volts? 

Vika: //I don’t know what it is.  

Oleg: //No, then, volts…

Vika: //It may be simply for…

Katya: //It’s for…for drilling, it’s drilling information.

Ashley: Yeah, okay. 

Katya: He is writing about two and eight, yes? Three hundred wattage. Fifty…

Will: So, we’re waiting…

Oleg: Yes, yes, yes. 

Katya: Yes, he’s writing to me about drilling. //But that doesn’t work for William.

Will: //We’re waiting for an answer... Twenty-four fourteen doesn’t work?

Katya: Will, can you please write to our operations specialist? 

Will: What? 

Katya: //That two and eight doesn’t work for you.

Ashley: //It’s saying, like, everybody is having good … it’s so funny.

Will: //I’ve written already, I’ve written already. 

Katya: //[UI]

00:57:30:00

Ashley: You’ve already let everyone know that “two eight” is not okay? 

Will: Yeah.

Ashley: Because everyone else is saying, like, “Two eight is so great!”

Will: Yeah, they did. They…they…they…

Ashley: Yeah, okay. 

Will: I…I…I…

Ashley: Okay. 

Will: To the structural geologist and…

Ashley: //And the engineering team. Did you tell the engineering team too? 

Vika: //Thirty-three thirty-one, please check.

Oleg: Thirty-three thirty-one… hold on. Thirty-three...thirty-three thirty-one.

Will: Point nine ninety-eight is lost.

00:57:58:00

Will: Thirty-seven twenty-six, they’re saying. Thirty-seven twenty-six...

Oleg: Oh, oh…Okay. 

Vika: Thirty-three thirty-one – is it okay?

Oleg: //Yes, thirty…

Will: //It’s not okay for me. Not okay for me.

Katya: //Thirty-three thirty-one – so, it’s a stretch.

Will: It doesn’t work. Point ninety-eight…//Ninety-eight percent loss.

Oleg: //[UI]

Will: Okay. 

Oleg: [UI] because water… Oh, not enough water. Well, two and eight they all...smashed it.

00:58:38:00

Katya: Again, very expensive. Again. Any other options?

Will: Well, we’re waiting for an answer about twenty-four fourteen.

Oleg: Twenty-four fourteen. 

Will: Yes, we’re still waiting for an answer to this.

Oleg: So…

Katya: Twenty-four fourteen, yes? 

Will: Yes. So, like, I know it’s on the border, but...

Oleg: Oh, they’re considering it now.

Katya: Damn, for me, twenty-four fourteen is very much okay. 

00:59:05:10

Katya: Fourteen…

Oleg: So…

Katya: Four…

Vika: Oops.

Katya: Fourteen…

Ashley: There’re five minutes left. 

Oleg: So, what are we doing? Making a decision? 

Ashley: Well, it was already four minutes ago, I think.

Katya: They’re taking a long time to respond, by the way. 

Ashley: Yes. Well, because there is…

00:59:30:20

Will: There are six minutes //between us.

Katya: //Maybe, they’re discussing.

Ashley: There’s a six-minute…delay. 

Katya: //Delay, yes.

Will: //Three minutes there and three minutes back.

Oleg: Oh, we have five minutes…//Point…

Will: //Thirty-two and six doesn’t really work.

Oleg: [UI]

Ashley: At first, we said “thirty-two fifteen”

Oleg: Yes, well, that one works.

Ashley: But, //they said it was a little expensive...

Will: //I’ve written to them…

Katya: And who said that Saleh and I are responsible for money? So strange… Who decides that it’s more expensive?

Katya: Do you have another person on the team? 

Ashley: So, on my team…

Katya: He didn’t say anything. Operation specialist. 

01:00:00:15

Katya: Who told you…

Ashley: //My team said that from…

Saleh: //Who is operation specialist? 

Katya: Her team said that. 

Saleh: Who is operation specialist? 

Will: I don’t know. //It’s just the operation specialist. 

Katya: //It’s our…

Saleh: I know, yeah. //But why is he not responding? 

Vika: //Thirty-two twenty-six doesn’t work at all.

Will: He’s responding to me. We’ve got a good working relationship. 

Saleh: He’s talking to you? 

Will: Yeah. 

Saleh: Really? 

Katya: Her team said that it’s too much expensive. 

Ashley: But I think, you know what? Let’s just…

Will: We’ve just got to get a response on twenty-four fourteen. We just don’t have a response yet. 

Saleh: Hm. We asked them also. 

Will: Yeah, I asked the operations specialist and the structural geologist. 

01:00:29:00

Ashley: If twenty-four fourteen doesn’t work, I think that we should resort back to thirty-two fifteen because…

Will: Thirty-two fifteen.

Ashley: if it’s just a little expensive on the maintenance side, maybe we can make that work. 

Will: //Okay, let’s see here. 

Katya: //But it’s good water, good place.

Ashley: //If it’s good for everybody else. Was it good water for you?

Vika: Yes. 

Katya: It’s just too expensive, so…

Ashley: It was good for hydrogeology…

Will: I mean…Not so good. They say, “not so good”. 

Ashley: For what? Twenty-four fourteen? 

Will: But…but not…it’s not negative. 

Ashley: Okay, but you…what was //the water situation like at thirty-two fifteen in the beginning? 

Vika: //For me it’s okay. 

Will: //Thirty-two fifteen. 

Katya: //Let’s say thirty-two fifteen, okay. 

Oleg: Which one?

Will: It’s okay. 

01:01:00:00

Katya: Thirty-two fifteen, after all, Oleg.

Oleg: Well, there, I also... Thirty-two fifteen, I have...

Katya: Well, for me, in general, it’s okay. I don’t know what’s there...

Will: Twenty-five forty-one.

Katya: The spot is bad, of course. Just the bottom line, but...

Ashley: What did you say? 

Oleg: But…

Will: They just sent me a new point – twenty-five forty-one. 

Saleh: We already used it. 

Oleg: But if there’s no water, someone said…//Will, did you say that there’s no water?

Katya: //Yes, thirty-two fifteen – no water?

Saleh: //It was not good for us. 

Will: In which one? 

Vika: There isn’t a lot of water there.

Oleg: //Thirty-two fifteen.

Saleh: //For us it’s too expensive. 

Vika: Yes.

Ashley: Yeah, what did you say about thirty-two fifteen? 

Vika: //Well, it’s good in terms of contamination, but...

Will: //It works, but it’s…

Ashley: I’m gonna say: // “Everyone here likes thirty-two fifteen.”

Oleg: //But, here, I have this…for human, who said, 

01:01:30:13

Oleg: he doesn’t object. 

Vika: Thirty-two fifteen isn’t too different...for me.

Katya: [UI]

Vika: Hold on. Twenty-four fourteen. 

01:02:20:25

Ashley: They say: “Everyone in Martian Analysis group is heavily leaning on “two eight””. How is that possible? That’s the one that you said has no water, right?

Will: Yeah. 

Saleh: He said he can’t do “twenty-four fourteen”.

Ashley: Yeah. 

Oleg: [UI]

Saleh: So, he’s suggesting now twenty-five forty-one. 

01:02:59:00

Ashley: Which one? Twenty-five forty-one? 

Saleh: No, this…

Ashley: What did you say? 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Ashley: Oh, we’ve already had that one before. 

Saleh: Yeah. We’re asking him now about thirty-two…

Ashley: No, that one is horrible. 

Saleh: Yeah. Yeah. 

Ashley: That one is really horrible. 

Will: Which one? 

Ashley: I hope, thirty-two fifteen just works. Let’s just…//Twenty-five forty-one is horrible.

Saleh: //[UI] 

01:03:26:20

Ashley: Alright. 

Will: Thirty-two fifteen, you said? 

Ashley: Yeah. I feel like…I mean, like you said, it’s gonna be a little more expensive for us, but…I think it’s probably worth it for everyone else, so…Let’s see if there is an agreement. 

01:03:57:10

Ashley: [UI]

Vika: Ash

Ashley: Yeah. 

Vika: Tell me please, um…What is your quality…so, temperature? Not quality, but highest…

Ashley: Like, temperature?

Vika: Temperature. 

01:04:30:10

Vika: //So…so…

Ashley: //So, I don’t really deal with temperature. 

Vika: Oh. Oh, so, sorry…So, what are you thinking about thirty-five twenty? 

Ashley: Twenty-five what?

Vika: Twenty. Thirty-five…Thirty-five twenty. 

Ashley: Oh, thirty-five. 

01:05:05:20

Ashley: Pretty darn good for me! 

Vika: Okay. 

Ashley: Um…

Oleg: So, let’s decide. To me, here, not one... More precisely, they answered, but... no one said anything against thirty-two seventeen. Oh! Now, human is saying something...

Vika: Thirty-two fifteen. 

Will: They’re saying: “We’re doing it – twenty-five forty-one”.

01:05:31:00

Oleg: Twenty-five forty-one? 

Will: That they’ll just do it. 

Ashley: Forty-one. What? No! That’s horrible!

Will: Twenty-five forty-one.

Katya: Oh, my God.

Ashley: That’s horrible!

Saleh: Why? What’s the reason?

Katya: For me, it’s okay.

Ashley: Because there are seven, six and three respectively yellow orange red zones which means that there’s gonna be a lot of dust storms. Why did we go with that one?

01:06:04:00

Oleg: What, has it stopped for us already? 

Ashley: Yeah, I think so. 

Vika: Not for me. 

Oleg: I already…oh, shoot, [UI]

Ashley: So, basically…

Katya: So, I can’t open my messages for some reason.

Oleg: That’s all. We’ve run out of time.

Vika: Oh, yes, you said they sent twenty-five forty-one.
 
Ashley: So, who puts the…are they putting…

01:06:30:00

Saleh: They said, twenty…//twenty-five forty-one. 

Ashley: //They are going with twenty-five forty-one? This is horrible. 

Will: I mean, it’s always gonna be horrible for somebody, right? But, I mean, I’m not sure. 

Ashley: Especially horrible. //I mean, it’s better with thirty-two fifteen. 

Saleh: //[UI]

Will: Yeah. 

Saleh: [SL] Drilling – one hundred eight. 

Oleg: Not working. 

Saleh: Steel. 

01:07:00:00

Oleg: Is it working for everyone? …It’s not working for me. 

Vika: Mine is working. 

Oleg: I can’t add points… Can you tell me, is your water is murky there or not?

Vika: Where? 

Oleg: Twenty-five forty-one… The water composition.

Vika: No. 

Oleg: Okay? 

Vika: Just large... large... large pollutant particles.

01:07:31:25

Oleg: And that’s all, yes? 

Vika: Mhm…But it doesn’t work for Will. 

Oleg: Too little water, yes? 

Will: It’s, like…

Vika: One hundred percent loss.

Will: One hundred percent loss.

Oleg: One hundred percent loss? 

Ashley: So, where…Are you in the signoff right now? 

Will: No. 

Ashley: Okay, so, that’s…

Katya: What? Thirty-two fifteen, I’m writing, yes, that’s what we want?

Vika: Yes. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

01:08:00:00

-

01:08:50:15

Will: And how…who can enter…

Vika: I can’t.

Saleh: Twenty-five forty-one. 

Will: Alright, twenty-five forty-one. That’s what I’m gonna do. 

Ashley: That’s not what we’re gonna do, but…

Will: I mean…So, who can put in…

Saleh: All of us are happy except Ashley. 

Will: Who can enter this?

Ashley: For twenty-five forty-one? 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Will: I’m not happy with it, but, I mean, it is what it is, so, twenty-five forty-one…

Saleh: But I mean the whole team there. 

Ashley: But how can you…

Katya: For me it’s terrible. 

Will: Who can enter? 

Ashley: I can’t. I do not…I’m not able to. 

Will: Okay. 

Ashley: So, I’m not sure…

01:09:23:00

Ashley: [SL] Is there anything that they’re writing here? 

Vika: What time was it, was it 2:40 when we started? 

Will: Oh. Sedimentologist…hold on.

Ashley: //[UI]…Only the geology team members can drag and drop [UI]

Oleg: //[UI]

Will: Okay, so, //[UI]

Oleg: //[UI]

Katya: Only Geology team members. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Katya: And who do we have as geologists? 

Vika: It’s us, Will and I.

Will: That’s us. 

Katya: Well, okay. 

Vika: And our friend. 

Will: But I can…

Vika: Oh, and I can. 

Oleg: So…

Will: Can you map cell?

Oleg: And, I only…

Vika: No, it’s just that I don’t understand where.

01:10:00:15

Ashley: Let’s say thirty-two fifteen. //I’m just kidding. 

Vika: //Oh, I can put it here. 

Saleh: Huh? 

Ashley: I’m telling her, she should just put “thirty-two fifteen” in. 

Vika: And where…where do I enter? 

Katya: Right here, perhaps. Map cell. 

Oleg: Um-m…

Vika: No, I can’t. 

Oleg: In the central panel.

Saleh: [UI]

Ashley: Soon, Saleh. You got an apple next to you if you need. 

Vika: No, I can’t. 

Oleg: Ash.

Ashley: Yes.

Oleg: //Tell me, please. Here, look, the central one is right here. You filled it out, didn’t you?

Vika: //Will, is it working for you? 

Will: //Mhm-hm.

Ashley: Not yet for me, because I can’t see…Okay. 

01:10:30:00

Ashley: Something has changed here. And who is planetary geology? Someone… someone needs to… give the numbers for Cell X and Cell Y.

Vika: I can’t enter anything yet.

Will: Okay, okay, okay…So…

Oleg: I can’t enter either. 

Will: Average…Material of average TBA. [UI]. Why can’t I…

01:10:59:00

Will: Cannot calculate. 

Oleg: I can’t enter. Can you enter things or not? 

Ashley: What? It’s been reset. 

Katya: Operation [SL] spell. Okay. 

Saleh: Ah…

Katya: Reset.

Oleg: [UI]

Saleh: It has been reset, Will. 

Ashley: Who is putting the maps off? 

Oleg: Oh, wow!

Ashley: Shut up!

01:11:30:25

Ashley: [SL] Now that you view my computer. 

Katya: I can’t view messages from… Vika, please tell me what I’m doing wrong. Look, I click on it and it doesn’t appear. It’s all frozen for me, yes?

Vika: Try clicking here…No, maybe, it’s…

Katya: Oh, okay.

Ashley: Why is it so…ugh…

01:12:07:11

Katya: I’m being ignored by the maintenance specialist. I wrote to him that it’s too deep, and he writes to me that they’ve chosen point twenty-five forty-one.

Vika: They’re all signing off.

01:12:36:28

Katya: Well, okay. 

Vika: Just you and us are left. 

Ashley: How is it, like…ugh…

Katya: I think they’re taking [UI]

Will: Can you see that it’s minus one minus one?

Vika: Yes, minus one minus one.

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: Yeah, I see it too. And why can’t I give my…ugh…decision for human factors? 

Oleg: Vika, have you done it there? 

Vika: No.

Oleg: Is anything being filled out for you?

Vika: No. 

01:13:02:10

Oleg: I can’t do anything. Has anyone completed, at least, signoff? …Will, are you filling out signoff? 

Vika: Signoff. 

Katya: Where is that? 

Will: No.

Vika: This thing here.

Oleg: In the center. 

Saleh: Why? 

Katya: //What’s happened? What’s happened? 

Ashley: //I didn’t input my stuff yet! 

Saleh: Martian meteorology specialist. You, huh?

Ashley: Give me a second! I need to input my decisions here! 

01:13:30:15

Katya: //[SL] Three hundred and twenty-four hours ago.

Ashley: //Oh, mother…my thing is, like, freezing!

Saleh: You signed off already. 

Ashley: I’m about to, if I can put my numbers in here. 

Oleg: [UI]

Vika: Oh. Oh. 

Ashley: Oh, come on! It’s so slow! Ugh…

Vika: Is it working? 

Oleg: What point did we decide on in the end?

Katya: What can be done here?!

Ashley: [SL] Attempt to modify…what? 

Katya: Where can I learn what point it is, in general? 

Ashley: Oh, my god!

Katya: What?

Saleh: [UI]

Ashley: It’s just not…okay, that’s fine. 

01:14:00:00

Vika: Why? What? What? 

Katya: What?

Ashley: Okay. Sedimentologist. Okay, so, that’s you. 

Will: That’s me. I did it, so that I could see if I could…

Katya: What are they doing? Explain. 

Oleg: Well, right now, they are retrieving the message about [UI]…process reset. 

Ashley: Yeah, I was gonna say, like, I really didn’t get any chance to input my…//But I haven’t yet given the decisions here.

Will: //Alright, fine. I’m not gonna…I’m not gonna try anymore. I’m just gonna stay. 

Oleg: How did you open this? Oh, this thing…

Katya: What are you doing? 

Vika: It was just my turn. And I have nothing here [UI]

Ashley: Oh, thank you!

01:14:30:00

Vika: Sorry. 

Ashley: No, that’s fine for me. 

Katya: What point is it? 

Vika: Oh, really? 

Ashley: I just wanted to add in my decision here. Oh, fuck!

Katya: What point is it?

Vika: What point? Yes, I don’t understand.

Katya: Yes. What are we talking about... everyone is turning it off, but what are we talking about? What point did we choose?

Vika: It’s, in short, my… well, it’s not my turn anymore.

Katya: I can’t even specify the drilling method because... Oh, that’s it. I’ll stay silent.

01:15:05:05

Vika: Can you? 

Katya: Everything is frozen for me here. 

Will: You can do it. 

Oleg: Oh, done. Pum-pum. Pum-pum. Plastic…plastic. 

Vika: [UI]

Will: When can we put our things? 

Katya: So, material specialist. Saleh…

01:15:30:00

Saleh: Hm? 

Katya: Um…Can you put, please, a drill brand and drill head?

Saleh: I put it already. 

Will: //Can you write?

Katya: Can you put it, because I don’t have. I wrote the drilling method.

Will: Can you write or not? 

Saleh: Point…

Vika: What? What? What? What?

Will: Things. 

Vika: Huh? 

Saleh: Twenty-five forty-one? 

Will: You can write things in your…

Saleh: Kate, which point? 

Oleg: So, what point did we have, at least? 

Katya: Yes. //Twenty-five fourty-one.

Vika: //Say again. What?

Ashley: //We’re still talking about twenty-five forty-one, right? 

Will: I don’t know. Can you write anything there at all or not?

Vika: No, I can’t write anything.

Will: Okay. 

01:16:00:16

Vika: I even… I tried to write in the lines for the hydrogeologist, but nothing happens. I can only click reject….

Ashley: We’re definitely talking about “twenty-five forty-one”, right?

Will: Mhm. 

Ashley: Yes? Okay. 

Oleg: Twenty-five forty-one? 

Ashley: Yes. 

Vika: I can choose the filters, at least. 

Ashley: Okay. So…

Oleg: Okay, these are big.

Ashley: I was able, my things…

Vika: Oh, Lord.

Ashley: Create.

Will: How did you change it? 

01:16:31:00

Ashley: Um…In the Signoff thin my dropdowns are actually working. 

Will: Oh. 

Ashley: Um, thank God. 

Katya: Can I sign off on this decision or not? 

Ashley: Just wait a second, because when you do, everything goes away, so…

Katya: Well, okay. I’ll just wait. 

Oleg: Fifty-six. 

01:17:04:18

Ashley: [UI]

Katya: Hm…

Ashley: Five…

Katya: Who are we waiting for now?

Will: I don’t know what we’re waiting for. 

Katya: Shall we, maybe, approve one after another?

01:17:30:05

Ashley: Okay, so…

Vika: Just approve?

Katya: What are we doing now? 

Oleg: No, wait. Hold on…

Ashley: So…

Vika: Oh, somebody…somebody called the point: “Best is twenty-five forty-one”.

Katya: Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. They chose it. //If it works for all of us…

Vika: //[UI]

Katya: Well, it works for all of us. We’re not going to argue with them now.

Will: Yes, yes, yes. 

Oleg: Yes.

Katya: It does work for all of us.

Will: Okay, let’s all click Signoff status. 

Katya: Let’s do it.

Will: Okay?

01:18:00:20

Will: Sedimentologist 

Vika: Okay. 

Oleg: Okay…[UI]

Ashley: So, you’re signing off?

Will: I can’t do anything. 

Oleg: And, it’s just, for me…

Will: Okay…Martian terrain specialist, structural geologist, sedimentologist…

Vika: It doesn’t want to do it for me. 

Will: Okay. Why is it showing that they are not…

Saleh: [UI]

Vika: [UI]

Ashley: I can’t anymore. 

Oleg: So, what did you click? 

Ashley: Once people start //signing off, you can’t…

Vika: //You just click on yourself.

Saleh: Hm. 

01:18:30:10

Vika: You check it. 

Ashley: I know. 

Vika: Yes. 

Saleh: [UI]

Will: What? 

Oleg: Nothing…oh, there. 

Will: Um…you are the material specialist. 

Katya: Mhm. 

Will: Just do it again. Tap it. //Here we go. Yes. 

Vika: //[UI]

Saleh: But still, I didn’t complete any. 

Will: Yeah, so…Ash, it’s still waiting on you. 

Ashley: I thought I already pressed this. Damn it! 

Will: You probably did. 

01:19:02:10

Will: [SL] Say yes. 

Ashley: I just…

Will: There we go. There we go. There we go. 

Ashley: Yeah? 

Will: Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. 

Oleg: [UI]…When…when is our next assignment? 

Ashley: Relay. So, we’ll have DeChurch…

Katya: //Oh, just a questionnaire.

Oleg: //Will there be questionnaires? 

Ashley: Yes, we’ll have those //Relay task too.

Salah: //DeChurch nine and ten. 

Oleg: There will also be communication, right?

01:19:30:00

Ashley: Remember, when we //communication…messages

Katya: //Messages.

Oleg: //Messages, yes. 

Ashley: Yes. //So, what’s happening? 

Katya: //What did they say? 

Oleg: Because we still have a whole hour

Ashley: Yes.

Oleg: before completion…and…

Saleh: DeChurch? 

Vika: [UI]

Ashley: Yes, but there is still a relay task we have to do after this. 

Saleh: Hm. 

Ashley: Yeah…But according to the instructions it says that DeChurch nine and ten are kind of done throughout this, so…I think it’s right after this first one. 

Vika: How’s your battery? 

01:19:59:09

Vika: Okay? 

Ashley: I’m hungry. Very hungry. 

Katya: It can feel it…chewing.

Oleg: Yes, it is…starting soon. 

Katya: Seven hours? 

Oleg: Turning off…the batteries. 

Ashley: So, is yours, like, kind of in freeze mode right now? 

Will: Yeah, //just give it a minute.

Oleg: //What are we waiting for now?

Will: We are waiting while…

Oleg: For the guys on the other end to accept everything? 

Katya: Damn, why is it taking so long? //They were the ones that chose the point.

Oleg: //For me, nothing…nothing is moving. 

01:20:30:05

Oleg: One thing that…do you remember what depth it was? 

Katya: One thousand…

Vika: The depth of what? 

Katya: Four hundred something. One thousand four hundred and eighty-two, to be exact. 

Oleg: In terms of energy, it was a match.

Vika: It is…not limited…

Katya: What matched? 

Oleg: In terms of energy, it’s very…

Katya: In terms of money, it’s also a match. We’ll be drilling for a long time.

Ashley: So, it, basically says that once we finish the Design task, complete survey DeChurch nine. Do you think we should just start? 

Vika: So…

01:20:59:10

Will: But don’t we gotta…why would we…I mean, do that right now? 

Ashley: It said…I mean, it says that it happens, like, throughout this. So, like, DeChurch ten is after the Relay one. 

Saleh: Okay. Let’s go. 

Ashley: //So, I don’t know. Should we start it? 

Oleg: //Okay, does anyone have anything live at all?

Will: Yeah. I mean, if it says it…

Vika: DeChurch now? Nine? 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Vika: Okay. 

Katya: Right now? 

Saleh: Multiteam task battery.

Will: So, I think this one sucks. 

Ashley: What? 

Will: I think this one sucks.

Saleh: Yeah.

Will: But I could be wrong. 

Ashley: So…

Oleg: Yes.

01:21:31:20

Ashley: Yeah, so, DeChurch nine. Ugh…

Oleg: DeChurch…Okay…

Katya: It’s a beautiful color.

Vika: Mhm. 

Oleg: DeChurch…

01:21:59:15

Oleg: Post…multiteam? Battery, right? 

Ashley: DeChurch nine. So, yeah post multiteam task battery. 

Oleg: There, DeChurch – good job. They translated everything here. 

01:22:32:18

Oleg: Very convenient. And that program part – not so much. 

Katya: You’re a mechanical engineer, Oleg, right? 

Oleg: No, I’m the bio. 

Katya: Bio? //Biochemical? 

Oleg: // Biochemical.

Ashley: //Biochemical. 

Katya: Biochemical. Okay. 

Oleg: Biochemical. 

01:23:04:12

Oleg: For drilling, for [UI]… I wanted to ask a question: What is a [SL] sedimentologist. It’s planetary geology.

Vika: Planetary geology is a group.

Oleg: And a sedimentologist? 

Vika: Hello, Google. Shoot, we don’t have Google. 

Oleg: That means we don’t know. 

01:23:33:00

Katya: Ashley, you are sedimentologist, right?

Saleh: Who is biochemical?

Ashley: No, that’s him.

Vika: Oleg. 

Saleh: You? 

Ashley: I’m the meteorology. 

Katya: Oh, okay. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

Saleh: Martian? 

Ashley: Martian meteorology, yeah. 

Oleg: [SL] How much will it be? 

Saleh: Vika?

Vika: Hydrogeologist. 

Ashley: Hydrogeologist. 

Vika: Hydro…

Ashley: Sorry. 

Vika: Thank you. Thank you. 

Saleh: Hydrogeologist. 

Vika: Thank you. 

Ashley: No, I was just clarifying, sorry.

01:24:11:10

Saleh: [SL] It’s written “Sirius”

Oleg: Okay…Okay…one, two, three…Oh! All five! I forgot myself. 

Vika: Oops. 

01:24:34:21 – 01:27:09:21

[no audio]

Oleg: Katya, which one is correct for you: drilling or operation? Drilling, right?

Katya: Drilling, yes, a drilling specialist.

01:27:17:22 – 01:30:52:26

[no audio]

Vika: What? 

Katya: This point was moving around here for me. 

Vika: I see. Hallucinations.

Katya: Look how beautiful it is. 

Vika: Oh, why are you doing this? 

Katya: I just accidentally pressed it with my hand.

Vika: Cool. 

Saleh: Ah, done. 

Katya: Good job.

Vika: Really? 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Katya: //[UI] NASA

Will: //Lucky man. 

Saleh: [UI]

Vika: //We’re NASA.

Oleg: Saleh, are you done? How fast you are, right? How did you do it? Without looking? So …//just put everything in the same spot? 

Saleh: [UI]

01:32:22:22 – 01:32:06:09

[no audio]

Katya: What? 

Vika: What? 

Oleg: You’re done, too? 

Will: Mhm. 

01:32:30:00

Saleh: You’re done, huh? 

Will: Okay…Do we log out of the Project RED? 

Saleh: Me? 

Will: I mean, all of us. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Oleg: [UI]

Will: Relay. 

Saleh: So, what do we have now? 

Will: Now we have Project RED Relay which is another type of task. You’ll see. It’s a lot easier and a lot cooler. 

01:33:03:00

Saleh: Mhm.

Will: I thought it said on the thing to do it after, though. 

Saleh: Which one? 

Will: I thought you said, it says that DeChurch nine…

Saleh: There is DeChurch ten also. 

Will: And ten. But after we do Project RED. 

Saleh: Yeah. 

Will: Whatever. If it says in the directions. 

Saleh: It’s mentioned [UI]

01:33:30:00

Katya: What, did we have it already? 

Vika: Yes, yes. 

Katya: Where are the prompts? I still don’t see the promised prompts.

Vika: What prompts? 

Katya: It says there: “There will be prompts”… “Carefully read the prompt” 

Vika: Maybe, they mean these things. 

Katya: Oh. 

Vika: Can you tell me, on the Signoff page…is something happening for you? 

Will: No.

Ashley: Not yet. 

Saleh: Should we sign off? 

Ashley: [UI]

Will: You already did. 

01:34:00:10

Saleh: Log out, I mean. 

Will: I guess so. Log out. 

Vika: Log out? 

Saleh: I don’t know. 

Will: Unless…//I don’t know. So, what do we have to do to go…

Saleh: //Ashley, we’re waiting for you. 

Ashley: I’m not the //only one still taking…I’m still…I’m still…

Saleh: //Everyone finished. 

Vika: Ash, we have to do…

Ashley: I’m still taking the survey. Give me a second. 

Will: Now, do we go to…

Ashley: We have some time to review the Relay. 

Katya: Oh, my God. I lost the…

Saleh: [UI]

Will: What did you lose? 

Vika: Your questionnaire? 

Katya: I lost Project RED. 

Will: Oh, that’s fine. 

Ashley: I think, it’s, probably, okay. 

01:34:30:09

Vika: Yeah. 

Ashley: I think we’re…

Vika: //Yes, I think so. 

Katya: //Should I open it again, yes? 

Will: Go to Desktop, and then we go to Project RED Relay, but don’t minimize this. 

Katya: Shoot, how do I do it? 

Will: Don’t minimize. You should open…

Saleh: Okay. 

Oleg: Hold on, hold on. 

Saleh: Huh? 

Will: So, open the…

Saleh: Where?

Will: //Open File Explorer.

Saleh: //[UI]

Will: So, open File Explorer.

Saleh: Here? 

Will: Mhm. 

Saleh: Go to your Desktop. 

Vika: Sorry. 

Oleg: //Damn!

Katya: //I didn’t minimize. 

01:35:02:00

Will: Mhm. 

Saleh: [UI]

Will: Go to Project RED Relay.

Vika: Oops. 

Katya: Project RED Design, right? 

Saleh: Design and Relay videos? 

Will: Project RED Relay. Not Project RED Design. 

Saleh: This is what? Oh, okay. 

Vika: Oh. 

Will: Okay. 

Saleh: [SL] Dragon?

Vika: [SL] Oh, huge. 

Saleh: Then? 

Katya: I opened it. 

01:35:29:08

Will: So, choose your… who you are.

Oleg: So, we’re continuing with these here? 

Ashley: Yes.

Katya: I don’t have the third tab. You neither, right? So, are we starting all over again? 

Vika: Let’s find it. What was it? Twenty…forty…

Will: So, now we choose two. Two people //that you’re gonna wanna send messages to. 

Katya: //Twenty-five forty-one. Twenty-five forty-one.

Vika: [UI]

Will: So, we’re opening Relay, when are we finishing? 

Vika: Oh, my previous ones…

Ashley: //I’m still not done here. 

Saleh: //Two people for…huh? 

Vika: It opened the previous points for me.

01:35:59:18

Saleh: So, I have to select two people //just to send them messages? Like in the previous task? 

Ashley: //Good idea.

Will: Yeah, so, we’re gonna get…there’s like…there’s like…no, no, no. There is like a fake email thing, and you just have to forward it to people. You don’t have to read it; you don’t have to do anything with it. You just…

Ashley: But you have to read, like, the topic of it, what it is, so that //you know, like, to who is a better person…

Will: //Yeah, yeah. There is a subject line. You read the subject line, and you forward it to one of the people that you choose. You have to choose two people.

Ashley: [UI]

Saleh: So, anything? Oh. 

Katya: And where is it? Where are we doing it? 

Vika: //Wait, is this Project RED again? 

Ashley: //Well, no. You pick two people in the beginning who you would like to be on your team, basically. 

Katya: //Where? 

Will: //Project RED relay. 

Vika: Oh. 

Will: Okay. Here’s how we do it. 

Ashley: And then they will give you something in your…

Vika: Okay. 

01:36:30:00

Ashley: mailbox, //and, say, like, the topic says “Oh, we need to know about depth of the drill, basically”. And out of the two people that you’ve picked, you pick who you think the best person would be to get that message next. 

Will: //We’ll say, we are doing…Desktop…

Vika: //Yeah. 

Will: //Damn!

Vika: Individual role. Where? No. 

Will: Mhm…Now...

Saleh: Who is mechanical engineer here? 

Ashley: [UI]

Will: It’s showing it. 

Katya: Relay.

Vika: Relay.

Katya: Relay. Mhm. 

Vika: Okay. 

Will: What is this? 

Ashley: Oh, my God! How many…

01:36:59:26

Saleh: [UI]

Will: Hold on, hold on, hold on…Yes. Let’s close, let’s close. Okay. Now, choose yourself. 

Saleh: Waiting for players to…

Katya: Thank you. 

Saleh: [UI]

Oleg: Okay…

Will: Hm? 

Saleh: //I put you? 

Oleg: //So, are we going back there? 

Will: Okay, yeah. Sure. 

Ashley: Alright. //Let’s all…let’s all relax because we’ve gotta start at the same time, so…

Saleh: //I think I will forward to you. 

Will: Well, no.// No. There is a lobby, so, it’s fine. 

Salah: //We stopped. We’re waiting. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: Okay, guys. Let’s go back to that…

01:37:30:00

Saleh: Sixty-six.

Ashley: Yes. //I think we can close it.

Vika: //Project RED Relay. 

Ashley: Yes. 

Will: Could you show him? 

Oleg: Shall I close RED? 

Ashley: Yes. And you can open Project Relay or Project RED Relay. 

Will: Just don’t minimize…//don’t minimize the camera. So, it’s like…

Katya: //Go to Desktop.

Oleg: Well, camera, yes, and here, //Project RED should I close it? 

Ashley: //Project RED you just close, right? 

Vika: To Desktop…

Will: Yes. Close it any way you want.

Ashley: [UI]

Oleg: And now – this one.

Vika: The next one.

01:38:01:10

Ashley: Design. Dude, stop! Like…

Oleg: Drilling?

Saleh: Seventy-five. 

Oleg: Okay, we choose. Who do we choose?

Will: Have you chosen already?

Vika: Yes.

Katya: Yes, we’re waiting for somebody…twenty-five percent…

Ashley: Jesus! You guys have all done the survey? 

01:38:32:20

Ashley: //You guys actually think about these?

Vika: //Yes, we are waiting for you, Ash.

Ashley: Okay, I’m just fucking slow apparently

Katya: //Can I drink some coffee?

Will: //Focus on the survey. Don’t think about other things.

Ashley: God! //[UI]

Katya: //Maybe some coffee?

Vika: Right now? Are you sure? Maybe yes.

Oleg: Which one?

Will: //Eighty-three percent…

Vika: //Maybe after that?

Ashley: [UI]

Vika: To take a break…

Ashley and Saleh: //[UI]

Vika: Oh my God…

Katya: Shall we get some dried strawberries? For snacking…

01:39:03:00

Vika: Guys, dry strawberry? Hm?

Ashley: Uh-huh.

Saleh: Yeah.

Ashley: [UI]

Vika: I’ll get it…Here it is. //Or is it on the first shelf? On the first shelf, hold on…

Saleh: //[SL] Why the AC is not working? Huh? Do you feel hot?

Will: No, I’m good.

Vika: Yes, there it is.

01:39:28:28

Katya: Found it?

Vika: Yes… Pass it on.

Will: Oleg has chosen, right?

Vika: No.

Oleg: What do you mean, no?

Vika: You need to go ahead and choose.

Oleg: I chose two persons. I chose myself and two people.

Katya: No.

Vika: It seems…

Oleg: See? There they are – one and two. Please choose two…

Vika: You only chose one.

Oleg: What if I do it this way? 

01:40:00:00

Vika: Now click Next.

Ashley: Jesus!

Oleg: Well, I was just waiting for everyone. Next?

Vika: Well, we’re all waiting.

Will: Okay.

Vika: Ninety-one.

Katya: Oleg.

Saleh: So, now we will start. Ninety-one, yeah?

Will: No, it’ll kick it over automatically.

Saleh:  So, this one is easy, yeah?

Ashley: Mhm.

Will: Oh, yeah.

Ashley: [UI]

Will: You’ll see. Don’t worry.

Salah: I didn’t do it the last time.

Will: I’ll walk you through…You’ll see on the left-hand side emails come in. You look at it, then click on it, and it will give you option to forward it to somebody. 

01:41:01:24

Will: //You have to forward it to one of the two people.

Vika: //[UI]

Katya: What’s there?	

Will: Based upon what it says on the title.

Vika: //I was afraid [UI]

Saleh: //In case if the subject is not related. Like, for example…

Will: If it’s not related to anybody in your list, just send it forward because maybe somebody in
your list can send it to somebody it is related to. So, the goal is to keep the inbox empty.

Saleh: Oh, okay.

Vika: Pass it on to everyone.

Will: Pass it on to everyone quickly.

01:41:32:00

Ashley: Oh, thank God! … Done!

Will: Hop right in. Let’s go.

Ashley: Okay. //So, now onto the Relay task.

Vika: //I want to open this.

Ashley: So…Desktop…Relay.

01:42:01:25

Will: Pass it on.

01:42:23:10

Will: Here we go. Okay, cool. Okay?... So, you see that message there? See how you can send it to
somebody?

01:42:59:00

Ashley: Are there any more strawberries?

Oleg: Okay…

Vika: Do we have none left?

Katya: Mhm.

Vika: Okay. Maybe later.

Ashley: No you’re fine. Okay. Take your time.

Will: Hm…

Oleg: Oh, it’s been ten minutes.

01:43:25:00

Saleh: How can we forward the message?

Will: You choose one. So, click on this one.

Ashley: You are waiting for a new message.

Will: Oh, you don’t have any?

Saleh: Oh, okay. 

Ashley: You don’t have any messages…Oh yeah, and there were strict instructions //that we are
not allowed to discuss things for this portion.

Oleg: //[UI]

Katya: Mhm.

Ashley: It’s a change from last time.

Will: You just gotta select it and send it.

01:44:01:00

Will: [UI]

Katya: My leg.

Will: This one?

Oleg: Material…Pumps…pumps…

Will: Sorry. What is this?

Oleg: [UI]

01:44:30:00

Oleg: [UI]

01:44:34:26 – 01:47:01:01

[no audio]

Will: Cool.

Katya: Excuse me, Oleg. It’s everything related to you.

Oleg: Yes, I understand. Everything has been resolved for me. I want to tell you that practically everything has reached us. Complete.

01:47:30:00

Katya: Mhm. 

Oleg: Very fortunate.

Katya: Water filtration – it is…Well, okay. I’ll send it.

Ashley: You don’t say.

Vika: Great. Now I know who you’re connected to…

Ashley: Yeah. They said that //we can’t…

Katya: //[UI]

Oleg: I do know who is sending messages to me.

Vika: Now I know //whom to send it to.

Ashley: //No communicating. 

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: No talking!

Oleg: I’m figuring out who is from where.

01:48:03:10

Oleg: Okay…Also leading.
