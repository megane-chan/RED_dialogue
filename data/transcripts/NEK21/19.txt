Transcript

Vika: //Only students.

Ashley: //They are on summer break. The school is over right now.

Will: What are you looking for?

Vika: I want to put something under it. There. I see it.

Will: Careful.

Ashley: Camera I got going…//voice recorder.

Will: //Do you have something?

Vika: //What?

Will: Do you have something?

Vika: Yes. So that you would shut up at last.

Ashley: Alright.

Will: This will help.

Ashley: Quickly.

00:00:29

Vika: Oopsies. Oops. 

Will: Bye. 

Ashley: Is it everything? Okay. Salah, you good too?

Will: Like Salah.

Ashley: Okay. Camera is On too?

Will: Yes. 

Ashley: Okay. Alright. Today is June 29th, 2022. Mission day 237. The time is 2:34PM. //Three, two, one, mark. 

Vika: //Three, two, one, mark. 

00:01:02

Vika: I didn’t say “mark”, sorry. But [UI].

Ashley: I think you’re fine.

Will: Yum-yum.

Vika: Yum-yum.

Vika: What number is DeChurch, tell me please?

Will: Yes.

Oleg: It is not DeChurch.

Ashley: It’s just design. Project RED Design. 

Vika: Thank you, guys!

Ashley: [UI]! No, I’m just kidding. No…Pains.

00:01:30

Vika: Pains?

Ashley: Pains everywhere. I’ll die. 

Vika: In my life? My life is pain.

Ashley: Hey there, team! Greetings from M Town. 

Vika: I’ll write down: Don’t listen to her. Don’t answer to her. 

Ashley: We are…

Vika: Awesome. We are awesome.

00:01:59

Ashley: …ready to start…

Vika: Wow!

Ashley: …last session.

00:02:29

Will: They said they’re having some technical issues. 

Salah: Who?

Ashley: Mechanical engineer mentioned it. 

Will: Everybody. 

00:03:01

Vika: It happens. There is nothing to be done.

Oleg: It may be eighteen twenty-five.

Vika: It needs to be.

Will: What?

Vika: Eighteen twenty-five …no water.

Will: No.

Oleg: No water, yes?

Vika: No.

00:03:30

Oleg: It is simply an ideal spot. 

Salah: Who is…Ash, you are Martian meteorologist?

Ashley: Yes.

Salah: Ah, okay. I caught you.
 
00:04:02

Ashley: Who else would’ve written that?

Salah: I thought Vika at the beginning.

Ashley: Ah, okay. 

Salah: [SL] Poopy soupy.

Vika: Huh? What? Where?

Salah: [UI]

Vika: Where is it?

Salah: I said: How come Vika [UI]

Vika: Poopy soupy? What? Where?

Ashley: I wrote it to him.

Vika: Ah. If you want, I can write it down. //Assign it to you.

Salah: //[UI]. 

00:04:30

Salah: This time it comes here. It’s weird. 

 Ashley: I was like Oh…

Oleg: Can you look at ten thirty-seven?

Ashley: Ten thirty-seven.

Will: One hundred percent water loss.

Ashley: Oh…said that it is not too bad.

Vika: What? One hundred percent water loss? 

00:05:02

Salah: Thirty twenty-one.

Ashley: Thirty…

Will: No water. Thirty twenty-one?

Salah: Yes. 

Vika: Yes, no water. Alright, alright!

00:05:34

Salah: Do you have to calculate before you make sure that there is no water? Or is it…

Will: No, no, no. So, at first, you check if there is water at all. Then you check the average water loss. //So, a zero in the amount of water, it is too little, then you don’t worry about it. If the average water loss is too high, then it doesn’t matter. You look at the amount of available water and then you look at the average water loss and you say: Okay, does this look in general like there is an amount of water…

Vika: //Hey Ash, did you send somewhere a message?

Ashley: //To them?

Vika: //To … yeah.
Ashley: //Yeah, I sent it to my team and mechanical engineer wrote to the engineering team saying that they are having technical issues. 

Vika: //Because I just didn’t see your messages.

Ashley: //You don’t see?

Oleg: Sixteen fourteen.

00:06:05

Salah: So, you can…

Will: You can kind of eyeball it and say…So, this has got a lot of water, but it’s got 100% water loss. 

Salah: Hm, okay. 

Will: So, one hundred percent water loss.

Vika: Oh.

00:06:30

Oleg: I have a feeling that you just need to look where there is water and for the rest just guess which one…Well, what about this one – nine twelve? 

Will: Nine twelve? There is no water.

Oleg: So there are problems with water.

00:07:08

Salah: Eleven thirty-five.

Will: 99% water loss. 

Salah: That’s okay. Better than 100%. 

Will: Better than 100, yeah.

Salah: It’s ninety-nine. 

Vika: Oops, I sent it to a wrong place.
Oleg: I have it here – five eighteen.

Vika: Alright.

00:07:30

Ashley: Five eighteen.

Will: There is no water.

Salah: Sixteen forty.

Vika: I sent to “pee pee, poo poo” structural geologist. 

Will: Structural geologist?

Salah: You sent it to who? Huh?

Will: What?

Salah: She sent it to who?

Will: Structural geologist. What number?

Salah: Sixteen forty. Pee pee, poo poo, huh?

00:08:01

Will: No water. No water.

Salah: Ninety-eight…

Oleg: Five twenty…

Will: Sixteen forty?

Salah: Sixteen forty, yeah.

Will: No water.

Oleg: Five twenty-two.

Salah: Five…

Oleg: [SL] Salik, it is good for you. I have your data.

Salah: Always.

Oleg: I don’t even say it when it doesn’t work for you.

Will: Not bad.

Oleg: Oh!

Will: Five twenty-two – it is good.

Ashley: What about nineteen forty-six?

Oleg: //Vika, look at five twenty-two.

Will: //Let me check. Give me two seconds to calculate.

00:08:30

Ashley: Which one was it? // Five twenty-two?

Oleg: // Five twenty-two.

Vika: It is good for me.

Salah: [UI] they crossed?

Ashley: No, no. Just that area seems to have good readings for me.

Will: Okay, what was your…

00:09:00

Ashley: Mine was nineteen forty-six.

Will: 99% water loss. 

Vika: But it is not better, Oleg.

Oleg: Is there a better one?

Vika: Not yet.

Will: I thought that five twenty-two is our best one now.

Vika: Well, for now, yes, but…

Ashley: What about ten forty-two?

00:09:32

Will: It’ll do, but it is not the best one.

Oleg: What if we try five thirty…

Vika: It seems to me that ten forty-two is better. //But there is less water there at ten forty-two.

Will: //Less water, yes. Yes, a lot.

Oleg: Five thirty-seven, Salah, perhaps you won’t like it but it is something.

Salah: Five?

Oleg: Five thirty-seven. You have a thousand deep…one thousand seven hundred and eighty-two.

00:10:06

Vika: It is perfect for cleanness.

Will: What? What number?

Oleg: Five thirty-seven.

Will: Did you see if there is water there?

Vika: There is water there.

Will: Five thirty-seven.

Vika: For me, in terms of the water area, for example, it is better than the previous one. Your spot. There is less water here.

Will: 94% water loss. There is no water there.

-

00:10:50

Will: They say eight nineteen. OK. I am checking.

Salah: Six forty. 

Will: Not bad. Eight nineteen. Eight nineteen is doable.

Ashley: Eight nineteen?

Will: Eight nineteen. 

Ashley: That’s one from who?

Will: Structural geologist.

Salah: I say it’s okay. 

Ashley: It’s mediocre for me. 

Vika: It’s okay. 

00:11:19

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: What about twenty-six forty-four?

Vika: Hm?

Ashley: Twenty-six forty-four. Twenty-six forty-four. Oh, shit. Martian terrain specialist coming to us from Thailand right now. 

Will: Nice!

00:11:53

Salah: He had COVID? 

Ashley: I think they are vacationing probably. 

Vika: No, twenty-six twenty-four…it’s so dirty.

Oleg: No way for twenty-six forty-four.

Will: Let’s put it like this: //We have two options. We have five twenty-two, eight nineteen and ten forty-two. Let’s choose one of those.

Vika: //Twenty-six twenty-four.

Ashley: //Hold on.

Salah: Ten forty…

Will: Five twenty-two, ten forty-two and eight nineteen. 

Oleg: Well, in terms of cleanness five twenty-two is the best. There is 0% loss.

00:12:22

Will: OK.

Vika: I agree with this one, but…

Oleg: But, if…

Vika: The water area is smaller there.

Oleg: There. But if it is eight nineteen, more can be cleaned, but there will be more loss.

Will: Hold on.

Oleg: The water is very murky there.

Vika: I am for five twenty-two.

00:12:56

Ashley: And I am for ten forty-two. It is my first spot.

Vika: Part of the crew. [UI].

Salah: So, which one is the best one?

Will: So, five twenty-two is the best for us. Eight nineteen is doable. So, now we just have to wait for them.

Ashley: What about ten forty-two? Is that not good for you all?

Will: Ten forty-two…that’s okay but it’s in the third place. 

Ashley: Hm. Fine. 

Vika: [UI]

Ashley: It’s the best one for me. Darn it! 

00:13:36

Vika: I…

-

00:14:00

-

00:14:33

Oleg: And what do you think of forty-six twenty-four?

Vika: Just a second.

-

00:14:57

Ashley: One more time.

Vika: Not bad.

Oleg: Forty-six twenty-four.

Ashley: Forty-six twenty-four.

Oleg: To the right.

Will: 95% water loss.

Ashley: For me, it is worse than the other variants.

Will: It will not do.

Salah: Six forty, yeah?

Will: Why are y’all still looking for points? Why are you still…We have two points. We just have to wait for them. Alright, hold on. 95%...

00:15:27

Ashley: Oh, I like that one a lot.

Will: What was the number again, Salah?

Salah: Six forty.

Will: Six forty. Okay. It’s not a lot of water. It’s pretty low. It’s maybe about a quarter of one of the other ones. It’s functional but it’s not…

Vika: So, we’re working on these points. I mean, that we have.

Salah: Which point?

Will: Five twenty-two and eight nineteen. We just have to wait.

00:15:58

Salah: Okay. Five twenty-two…

Vika: Okay. 

Oleg: Salya, what other parameters, besides depth, do you have? What else do you have?

Will: What other parameters other than the depth.

Salah: Like…construction suitability. 

Will: How to build…

Salah: I don’t know how to say it in Russian. 

Will: I don’t know how to say it in Russian either. 

00:16:30

Ashley: Ability to build?

Will: Ability to build. Perhaps.

Vika: And do they agree to…

Salah: Which one?

Vika: I can’t look it up.

Ashley: So, our two suggestions right now are five twenty-two and eight nineteen. Right?

Will: Yeah, five twenty-two and eight nineteen.

00:17:00

Will: Eight nineteen was…they chose. 

-

00:17:30

-

00:18:04

Ashley: Oops. 

Vika: [SL] Boy what?

Ashley: Fuck. Didn’t mean to put that. Oops.

00:18:29

Salah: So, between five twenty-two and eight nineteen which one is…

Will: I mean either… the one that has more water is five twenty-two, but…

Salah: I like, actually, five twenty-two more than eight nineteen.

Will: So, yes. I said that was our number one and eight nineteen is doable. 

00:19:02

Ashley: [SL] Are you eating?

Oleg: No, thank you…Have they written? What else do they want, besides eight nineteen?

Will: They have not responded.

00:19:30

-

00:20:00

-

00:20:30

-

00:21:00

-

00:21:24

Vika: Yes, oops.

Will: It is mine.

Vika: This one is yours.

Will: It also happens. This one is definitely for me…It happens.

00:22:00

Vika: I knew that. 

Oleg: And what about this one, twenty forty-one?

Will: There is no water.

00:22:31

Vika: I almost dialed the second number. It is too bad, we can’t play music.

Will: Hm?

Vika: It is too bad, we can’t play music.

00:23:14

Oleg: Here is a good one – nine eighteen.

Will: No water.

Salah: Are they still sleeping or what?

Will: I guess so. 

Salah: No one is replying to me. 

00:23:46

Will: Structural geologist has been pretty good. //Mechanical engineer…

Ashley: //Yeah, Martial terrain specialist and mechanical engineer are both replying a lot. Even from Thailand.

Will: Which one is in Thailand?

Ashley: Martian terrain specialist. She is in Bangkok. Or he. I don’t know, actually, today which one. Actually, that’s another thing. I wanted to get that video from you. The Project RED video.

Will: Yes, yes, yes.

Vika: Quickly yes. 

00:24:24

Ashley: I wonder what they thought of us when they saw our video.

Will: They probably [UI] go yeet…

Oleg: Here it is, fourteen thirty-eight.

Will: No water.

00:25:06

Ashley: Alright, throw me a bone here and check twenty-two forty-five.

Will: Okay.

Vika: Twenty-two forty-five?

Ashley: Yes.

 Will: 100% water loss. 

Vika: It happens. There is nothing to be done.

00:25:40

Oleg: Thirty-three forty.

Will: No water.

Oleg: Surprisingly, there is none at all today.

Will: Well, we have three spots where there is some.

Ashley: Is there like a good water amount in ours or, like…

Will: They seem to like both of them. Eight nineteen and five twenty-two.

00:26:09

Ashley: But it’s like…how much water loss do we actually have there?

Will: We actually end up with quite a bit of water. For five twenty-two we end up with hundred thousand. That’s actually the size, as somebody said, of the aquifer after the loss. For eight nineteen we end up eighty-two thousand, which is decent.

Ashley: Will they ask about the ‘aquifires’ thing? What does that mean?

Will: The what?

Ashley: The “aquafires” or something. Because I know they ask…

Will: The aquifers? 

Ashley: Yeah. What does that mean?

00:26:34

Will: An aquifer is a…It’s like a space or a…like an area of rock that holds water. So, you can have aquifers that are deep or aquifers that are higher, but basically its where water sits inside…inside rock. It can be, basically, like a cavernous type deal or it can be…actually be within the rock itself. 

00:27:12

Will: Okay, so, they are checking out five twenty-two.

-

00:27:38

Vika: Oh, that is it. Cool.

-

00:28:00

-

00:28:30

-

00:29:00

-

00:29:25

Oleg: Here is another good one – thirty twenty-six…Is there some there?

Will: Are you checking?

Vika: No. I will do it now.

00:30:00

-

00:30:30

-

00:31:00

-

00:31:35

Will: [PH] Bep.

Oleg: So what? Is there none at thirty twenty-six?

Will: Hold on…Thirty…

Oleg: Twenty-six.

Will: None.

Vika: At all. [UI]

00:32:00

-

00:32:30

-

00:33:00

-

00:33:32

Ashley: I want to be in Thailand. [UI]

Will: Have you been there?

Ashley: I have not yet. 

Will: Me either. I would like to. 

Ashley: Also, I feel like I would just be eating my way through Thailand because Thai food is my number one favorite food.

Will: Oh yeah. A true delight.

Ashley: A true delight.

Will: It do be. 

00:34:06

Oleg: Will we be waiting for their response?

Will: What else is there to do?

Oleg: I have a feeling that they have all left on vacation.

Will: Exactly.

Ashley: Yes.

Oleg: And there is one person doing everyone’s work. Who is it?

Will: Yeah, structural geologist.

00:34:30

Oleg: Nobody wants to get up early in the morning. It is morning for them now, right?

Will: If they are in America, yes. But if they are somewhere else…

Oleg: Do you mean to say that not everyone is in America?

Will: At least one is in Thailand.

Ashley: One lady from my team said that she is in Thailand now.

00:34:58

Ashley: I see, it is just that the university academic year ends in May. [UI]

-

00:35:30

-

00:36:00

-

00:36:17

Will: Phew, phew, phew…

Oleg: How long has it been now? Twenty minutes? It will soon be an hour for us…

Ashley: Well, it is time already [UI]

Oleg: They should give us some response. At least…

Will: Alright. Any updates on five twenty-two or eight nineteen?

00:36:49

Oleg: [SL] There is more here, Vika. I have gone through everything here.

-

00:37:26

Oleg: It is simply ideal. Thirty-one twenty-nine. It is crystal clear water.

Vika: Say again.

Oleg: Thirty-one twenty-nine.

Ashley: Okay.

00:38:00

-

00:38:30

-

00:38:45

Will: Looks like five twenty-two is alright. Alright, let me get that down. 

00:39:15

Oleg: So what?

Vika: Twenty-nine.

Oleg: Thirty-one twenty-nine.

Vika: No water.

Oleg: How can it be?

Will: They have chosen five twenty-two in the end.

Oleg: They have confirmed, right?

Will: Yes.

Oleg: Excellent.

Ashley: Okay. 

00:39:45

Oleg: So, this time they decided not to resist. Just agree and that’s it.

Will: No, they were considering five twenty-two and eight nineteen. 

00:40:03

Oleg: And you have a lot of loss at five twenty-two?

Will: Fifty-four, but it should be visible there. Geology calculated value is 54% water loss, but we have two thousand twenty-eight, so it means…

Oleg: It is the water reserves, right?

Will: Yes, so we have a lot of water there.

Oleg: How large a colony is it sufficient for?

Will: Two thousand eight hundred now.

00:40:31

Oleg: And we need to provide for up to ten thousand, right?

Will: I don’t know.

Oleg: We had it somewhere at the beginning …We need to provide for a settlement of ten thousand people.

Will: I can’t remember.

Oleg: Does someone have the information about the number of people?

Vika: I just opened it.

00:41:01

Oleg: This was, I think, in the audio…it was in the videos.

Ashley: You want to have //ten thousand to fifty thousand gallons per day. Ten thousand people. Zero to ten thousand people. 

Vika: //Ten thousand.

Will: We’ll see. Oh, zero to ten thousand people. That’s the range.

Ashley: Oh, sorry, //accessibility range is for that. 

Vika: Zero to ten thousand.

Will: Yes, it means that zero to…

Ashley: You want to maximize the amount of people who can…

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: [UI] with the amount of water. It should range from ten thousand gallons to fifty thousand per day. 

00:41:32

Will: Okay, yeah. It is…

Oleg: Salya, do you have something interesting to say based on your materials, about five twenty-two? So we can have an idea of what materials you are evaluating.

Salah: [UI]

Oleg: What is it? For which indicator? Good, bad or…

Salah: Okay.

00:42:00

-

00:42:46

Vika: Dang. Why can’t I here…

-

00:43:00

-

00:43:30

-

00:43:57

Will: It feels like the delay is actually less today. When they do respond. 

Ashley: Mhm. I agree. 

Will: Maybe they switched it up for us. 

Oleg: You there Sign off…

Will: Hm?

Oleg: Name.

Will: Yes. Everyone there adds something. 

Oleg: Three and a half days are left.

Ashley: What did you…what did you write there?

Will: [SL] MTS [UI] team, sub mission 3.5 days in isolation left.

00:44:34

Oleg: Today, we have passed the point of one hundred hours left before the end of the isolation.

Ashley: Wow!

Vika: What shall we sing? Songs!

Ashley: Yes…

Salah: Oleg, this is your information. //Sign off, biochemical engineer. 

Ashley://Perhaps, it is my song? [UI] [singing]

Vika: Okay, or we can [UI]

00:45:02

Ashley: [singing]. I’ll do the whole thing. // [Singing]

Vika: //I have gone mad. I have gone mad. I have completely gone mad.

Ashley: [singing]

00:45:35

Oleg: Salah, I have everything.

Salah: Ah, okay. You got it. 

Ashley: //[singing]

Vika: //Don’t fart at my door.

Ashley: [singing]. I plan on filming that today.

00:46:00

Oleg: It is the confirmation coming our way. Mechanical engineer.

Ashley: [SL] Alright, I will too.

Vika: There is nothing to be done.

Oleg: [UI]

00:46:28

Will: Oh, they already…

Ashley: We’re already signing off. Where are you?

Salah: [UI]

Ashley: I’m just talking to him. [SL] Don’t worry. [singing]

00:46:57

Ashley: I haven’t figured out the melody for the ending yet…Copyright on those song lyrics and audio file here.

00:47:30

-

00:47:56

Ashley: Wow, I’m an idiot. 

Vika: It happens. 

Ashley: Whenever we have the survey about Project Red, they mention at the end, like, the Notes tab. 

Will: Yeah, but the notes tab doesn’t, like, do anything.

Ashley: I didn’t realize that the Notes meant the little…the information that pops up. Cause it’s map and Notes, so I assumed that Notes are the things that pop up. 

Will: No, there is a specific thing.

Ashley: Is there?

Will: Yeah, I don’t know where it is. 

Ashley: I’m always, like: Umm, I don’t use it because I don’t know what it is. 

Will: Yeah, I thought there was something that said, actually, like…

Ashley: I thought there was, too. That’s why…

00:48:29

Will: There is Info Database…

Ashley: Cause on the top…I don’t know…I just see map and Notes, so I assume that’s supposed to be it, but who knows. 

Oleg: Vika, you need to do it.

Vika: Hm?

Oleg: Check it.

Vika: I have already checked it. Yes, I have already checked it. That is interesting. I have already confirmed, and it did not…

00:49:00

-

00:49:15

Oleg: Maintenance specialist is dragging his feet.

00:49:30

-

00:50:00

-

00:50:30

-

00:50:45

Vika: Was Tereshkova’s flight in nineteen sixty-three?

Oleg: Yes. On the eighteenth of March. Wait, on the sixth of March or the eighteenth of March. Stop, no. I got it all wrong. The eighteenth of June. It was in June.

Vika: And what is your final answer?

Oleg: The eighteenth of June, year nineteen sixty-three.

Vika: Or the eighteenth of March?

Ashley: //You guys are going to hate me.

Oleg: //It was on the eighteenth of March in nineteen sixty-five.

Vika: And Titov’s flight was in sixty-two. In nineteen sixty-two.

Oleg: Yes. Sixty…

00:51:22

Oleg: And what have you decided on?

Vika: There is a discussion here.

Oleg: Oh, it is this one. Tereshkova is no longer in the field of vision.

Vika: Fuck.

Ashley: Sorry, that’s my teams fault. 

Will: Oh, we didn’t finish? Okay, everybody’s got to hit it again.

Vika: Well, okay.

00:51:51

Ashley: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Don’t start. Don’t start rechecking it. 

Will: Okay. 

Ashley: Because that was the whole reason. The whole reason was //that my team… the girl on my team wanted me to reject for something. 

Vika: //Don’t stop me now! 

Vika: Oops.

Ashley: But…yeah. Don’t check! Nobody! Hang on!

Salah: Why has been reset by you?

Ashley: Because //the girl on my team asked me to…

Will: //Because she asked…

Ashley: [UI]

Will: Are they ready?

00:52:26

Ashley: Okay, well, that’s okay. Okay. Alright, it’s good now. She changed what she wanted to change.

Will: Okay. 

Vika: Okay. Thanks God!

00:53:00

-

00:53:30

-

00:54:02

Oleg: Salya, do you want to check it?

Salah: What? 

Oleg: Do you want to check it…put your checkmark there?

Salah: I did.

00:54:47

Oleg: Look, there is only the operations specialist left and that’s it.

Will: They are…it is a different person doing these; so they are working on two computers so it may take longer.

Ashley: Done.

Oleg: So, there is one for two?

Will: Yes. Some are doing it this way today.

Ashley: I think that I have completed it, right? Now?

Will: Let me take a look. Yes.

00:55:16

Ashley: Okay. 

Vika: That’s it, right?

Ashley: Yeah, survey time. 

Vika: Okay. Which one?

Ashley: Nine. 

Vika: Thank you. 

00:55:47

Vika: DeChurch nine?

Ashley: Yes. 

Vika: Great. Cool.   

00:56:10

Oleg: DeChurch which one?

Ashley: Nine.
