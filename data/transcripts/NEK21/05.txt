Ashley: It is December 14th, 2021. The time is 3:29PM. Three, two, one. //Mark!

All: //Mark!

Ashley: Okay. So, let’s establish contact.

Oleg: And now the most suitable for us is twenty-two twenty-nine, right? Pardon. It is seventeen thirty-eight.

Vika: Seventeen thirty-eight. 

00:00:34:07

Will: Which one?

Oleg: Seventeen thirty-eight.

Ashley: The one that you liked.

Will: Okay. Yeah, that one works. 
Ashley: Yeah, it works for me. I said, “Greetings from Moscow! It is 15:30 //local time”.

Oleg: //So, I also approve seventeen thirty-eight then ... Ash, you write the time, do you?

Ashley: Yes. 15:30 local. Moscow Standard Time. 

00:01:02:23

Will: What’s your title? Martian weather…

Ashley: Meteorologist.

Will: Martian meteorologist.

Ashley: Should I…

Will: What’s your…You are the…

Salah: Material specialist.

Will: What about you, Oleg?

Oleg: I am a biochemist.

Will: Okay. 

Salah: Bio…bio…

Oleg: Biomechanic.

Will: What about you? 

Vika: Geologist?

Will: What kind of?

Vika: Hydrogeologist.

Will: Hydro. 

Ashley: So should I offer my 

00:01:29:26

Ashley: team seventeen thirty-eight?

Oleg: Yes.

Will: Yes. Yes. Wait a minute. 

Salah: So, we agreed on seventeen thirty-eight?

Will: That’s one point. We are still looking for more. 

00:02:13:04

Salah: Check twenty-seven thirty-two.

Will: Twenty-seven thirty-two.

Ashley: Twenty-seven thirty-two.

Vika: Twenty-seven thirty-two.

Will: No water. 

Ashley: At all?

 00:02:30:16

Will: At all.

Salah: I should really check with you. 

Ashley: What about //fifteen thirty-six?

Vika: //There is a massive water loss.

Will: Fifteen thirty-six.

Vika: [SL] Twenty twenty two…Thirteen?

Ashley: Fifteen.

Vika: Fifteen. 

Ashley: Thirty-six. //Fifteen thirty-six.

Vika: //Thirty-six. 

Salah: It’s too deep.

Ashley: Too deep?

Salah: Yeah, almost //two kilometers. 

Will: //Oh, fuck.

Ashley: What about twenty-seven twenty two?

00:03:07:15

Will: No water. 

Ashley: Darn it. //What a buzzkill!

Vika: //A massive...a huge water loss. 

Will: Okay, that was what?

Oleg: Twenty-seven twenty two. In general not bad one. 

Ashley: Which one?

Oleg: Twenty-seven twenty two.

Vika: We have already checked it. 

Ashley: I think William said //that there is no water there.

Will: //There is no water, so…

Ashley: It’s too bad.

Oleg: I have a feeling that the most important thing is to have water in there. 

00:03:32:24

Salah: //That’s good. 

Will: //Well...that is...really important.

Salah: This is good.

Oleg: That’s what I meant. And after that…

Salah: Nine thirty-four. 

Will: Nine thirty-four. Let’s see. 

Oleg: Nine…

Ashley: Nine thirty-four. 

Salah: What?

Will: There is no water.

Ashley: What about twelve forty-three?

Vika: Forty?

Ashley: Forty-three. So, twelve //forty-three.

Will: //Twelve…

Vika: Mhm.

Will: What is it?

Ashley: Twelve forty-three.

00:04:01:18

Oleg: Okay, twelve forty-three. Twelve…

Salah: Twelve forty-three, yeah?

Vika: A massive water loss. 

Will: No water. 

Oleg: Crap…

Ashley: Darn it, Will!

Oleg: It’s fine. What’s wrong?

Will: Okay. Give me another one.

Ashley: Yeah. 

Salah: Will, check twenty-six…

Will: Twenty-six…

Salah: Twenty-nine.

Will: Twenty-nine.

Oleg: That is, I suppose we have to wait until the water is found. 

Will: Twenty-six twenty-nine.

00:04:31:03

Salah: He gives me smile. 

Will: No, no water.

Vika: A massive water loss.

Ashley: Did you say fifteen thirty-six also had no water?

Will: Twenty-six twenty…Fifteen thirty-six. Almost no water. There is, like, nine hundred there, or something. 

Oleg: Does this mean that we cancel seventeen thirty-eight, right? There is no water, is it?

Ashley: Seventeen thirty-eight?

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: No. We offered this, did we?

00:05:00:19

Oleg: Yes. Shall we keep it or....

Ashley: I think we keep it and give them time to write us about their decision. So what else was there...

Vika: Sixteen eighteen.

Oleg: Sixteen eighteen.

Ashley: Sixteen eighteen. Sixteen eighteen. Let’s see what you bring. …For me it’s not bad.

Will: Not bad... well it’s not actually great. There is not enough water, but...

00:05:31:09

Vika: Especially for Oleg, yes, yes. Wait for Oleg to say something about it...

Oleg: Yes.

Will: Okay. It is bad for you, is it?

Vika: With mineral...

Oleg: Yes. I have a mineral limit. //In general, it is possible to purify it.

Salah: //Sixteen eighteen?

Ashley: Yeah, that’s what…

Oleg: If there //a large supply of water, then it would be possible.

Ashley: //How is it for you?

Vika: There is enough water supply. And the water loss is small.

Salah: This is good. Sixteen eighteen.

Vika: Okay.

Ashley: It's not good for you or...

Oleg: Well, the point is that there will be losses, but at least it means that there is water and it can be purified. 

Ashley: How much water is there? I mean is there plenty or not.

00:06:00:27

Will: There is…hold on. There is fifty thousand there. As opposed to two hundred fourteen thousand on the other one.

Salah: What’s your requirement?

Will: But it’s …

Ashley: So as we see…

Will: I mean…We want above fifty thousand. Fifty thousand is our minimum cutoff. 

Salah: Fifty thousand?

Will: Yeah. 

Salah: Above.

Will: Whereas the other one…it’s like…Yeah, fifty thousand of usable water. Because there is also average water loss. So…

00:06:30:29

Oleg: What is most interesting, here, along the channel up this ...so-called river ...

Salah: I have a good idea. Let Will check if there is water and then we should after.

Will: Yeah…So, yeah. So, we have…

Ashley: What about anything in that lower left corner?

00:07:01:04

Ashley: Is anything there good //for you? No?

Oleg: //How about this? Nineteen thirty-five.

00:07:07:12 – 00:07:29:01

[no audio] 

Oleg: Very clean water. I don't know what is there...

Ashley: Could be better for me, but possible.

Vika: Fine. 

Will: Which one?

Oleg: Nineteen thirty-five?

Will: Nineteen...

Ashley: Have your teams already answered you or not?

Oleg: No, no one has answered me yet.

Ashley: Me too. 

Will: Nineteen thirty-five, right? Thirty-five... Nineteen... oh wait. Nineteen...

Vika: Nineteen thirty-five. 

Will: Or twelve?

Oleg: //Nineteen.

Vika: //Nineteen thirty-five. 

Salah: Nineteen. 

00:08:00:15 -00:08:27:07

[No audio]

Ashley: What about twenty-five three?

Oleg: Twenty-five three. 

Will: Maybe. One minute.

Ashley: Perhaps nineteen thirty-five, you say?

Will: That’s right.

Ashley: Okay.

Oleg: So, Ash, what's yours?

Ashley: I said twenty-five three. 

Vika: Twenty-five... three. Very dirty water. 

Ashley: Dirty?

Vika: Mhm. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: Yes. 

Will: Yes. //Nineteen thirty-five will probably work. 

Ashley: //So it's not okay. 

00:09:02:03

Will: This is like right on the border of what we can accept, but ...

Vika: Not the best point. 

Ashley: It’s not?

Will: What is next?

Salah: So, what do you think about it?

Will: Nineteen thirty-five?

Salah: Yeah.

Will: It’s passable.

Salah: //Passable. Check nineteen thirty-four.

Ashley: //But Vika says…Vika says, maybe not. Right?

Vika: Yeah, it’s…

Will: Which one?

Salah: Thirty-four. Not thirty-five.

Will: Nineteen thirty-four?

Vika: We have better. 

Ashley: Yep. 

Will: That looks really good. Nineteen thirty-four looks //really good. Let me run the numbers on this one. 

Salah: //Thirty-four. 

00:09:30:29

Will: Nineteen thirty-four. 

Vika: Thirty-four...Oleg, what do you think about nineteen thirty-four?

Will: That’s really good. 

Salah: //It’s really good for me. Even depth. 

Vika: //Small…small contamination.

Oleg: Nineteen thirty-four?

Salah: Yeah.

Vika: Nineteen thirty-four. 

Salah: By mistake I took that.

Oleg: Well...

00:10:02:24

Oleg: Well...

Vika: What's there?

Oleg: Crap! There's too much... But, again, we can... we can clean the water of it. The double filtering will be needed. That’s okay. 

Vika: For me it’s normal too.

Oleg: What about the supplies?

Vika: [UI]

Ashley: Not the best for me. Lots of red zones. This means that the weather there is not very good, but…

Vika: Nineteen thirty-four — no way. Really?

00:10:30:09

Vika: Okay. 

Ashley: Not the best one. 

Salah: It’s not good with you?

Ashley: Yeah. It’s not the best. There is a lot of red zones, which means that there is a…Oh, there’s a message from my team. They said “Hello. We are all in //different places today. So sorry for the delay." They're looking at seventeen thirty-eight now.

Salah: //But what’s…The number of contaminants is really high?

Will: //The what?

Salah: //For…

Will: //Nineteen thirty-four?

Salah: //Yeah. 

Vika: Mhm.

Will: Seventeen thirty-eight. 

Oleg: Mhm.

00:11:00:15

Vika: We have already seen this point. 

Oleg: Yes. Well, I wrote that...

Ashley: Yes, we already wrote...

Will: Seventeen thirty-nine. Have we looked at seventeen thirty-eight?

Vika: Yes.

Will: Oh yes, yes.

Ashley: Yeah, so they're looking at it now. Do we have another point that //we can agree on?

Will: //What about seventeen thirty-nine?

Ashely: Seventeen thirty-nine?

Will: Yes. 

Ashley: Seventeen...

Vika: Looking at it right now. 

Ashley: Thirty-nine. 

00:11:37:01

Will: So what? Is there anything?

Vika: Very high contamination. 

Oleg: Yes, very high...

Vika: Seventeen thirty-nine. 

Oleg: It’s too muddy. 

Vika: But seventeen thirty-eight is fine. 

Oleg: Yes. 

Ashley: Thirteen... what?

Vika: Seventeen thirty-eight.

Ashley: Seventeen. 

Oleg: Yes, very close, but //here is the extreme rate. I won’t be able to purify it. At all. 

Vika: //Seventeen thirty-eight. 

Will: Yes, yes, yes. Seventeen thirty-eight. 

00:12:00:16

Will: I got this wrong. It was seventeen thirty-nine.

Oleg: Yes. 

Will: The one I was talking about. It was okay. Seventeen thirty-eight — no. I mixed it up when I was saying that. 

Vika: So you mean seventeen thirty-eight ...

Will: Yeah.

Ashley: Oh. Because they're talking about “thirty-eight” now. 

Vika: Oopie. 

Salah: Which point?

Ashley: What was the one that you said? You said nineteen thirty-four?

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: What did you think of nineteen thirty-four? What did Salah say?

Oleg: Which one? Nineteen thirty-four?

Vika: Nineteen thirty-five. 

Salah: //Will agreed. 

Ashley: //Thirty-four. 

00:12:31:02

Vika: One minute. Don’t remember. 

Ashley: Thirty-four. 

Vika: I have already removed that point. Therefore it didn't fit me. Very high contamination. It wouldn’t work. 

Ashley: Ah, too much contamination, she says.

Vika: Yeah. 

Oleg: Yes, it is too high. If only there were sixty at least. 

Vika: So…

Ashley: Have you looked at twenty-five three?

Vika: Twenty-five three? It’s fine.

Ashley: Is it okay for you?

Will: Twenty-five...

Vika: Yes. And what will Oleg //say about contamination?

Ashley: //What do you say?

00:12:59:28

Oleg: Well, basically, it may work. //Bad, but possible.

Ashley: //What did you think of twenty-five three? …You, William.  //A very important person.

Will: //I’m taking a look. There is water there. Let me just see how much. 

Salah: Twenty-five three?

Ashley: Mhm. 

Salah: Yeah, that’s good. 

Ashley: So can we ... can we offer it already or not?

00:13:30:12

Will: It’s not really a lot going on. 

Oleg: [UI]. Please… Well, they want us too…

Vika: Okay. It is a Sign Off, right?

Will: No. //It’s just…

Ashley: //Not yet. They just... We don't start it. We're just still discussing.

Vika: Okay. 

00:13:58:10

Vika: Where is our [SL] meteorologist?

Ashley: So you didn't like...you don't like twenty-five three?

Vika: Not the best point...we reject nineteen thirty-five. Really?

Oleg: Nineteen thirty-five. //I wouldn't.

Vika: //It was good. 

Oleg: [SL] I wouldn't keep it. 

Vika: But there is only large contamination. This means it can be cleaned up. 

00:14:32:17

Oleg: //These are large. Well, how to say...

Ashley: //What about twenty-seven five?

Vika: Twenty-seven five. 

Oleg: As for twenty-seven five we don't... I didn't check. 

Vika: Me either. 

Ashley: Look please. 

Vika: Okay. 

Oleg: Let's have a look. Well...

Ashley: Really?

00:15:00:28

Vika: A massive water loss. It’s a definite “No”. 

Ashley: Vika!

Vika: Sorry. But you were so close…Okay. Darn it... I’m...sorry. [SL] What’s so funny?

Oleg: [SL] It doesn’t get old. 

Vika: Who wants an apple?

Ashley: Eleven fourteen. 

00:15:31:02

Vika: Eleven fourteen.

Oleg: Twelve. 

Ashley:  Eleven fourteen. 

Oleg: Eleven fourteen.

Ashley: Eleven fourteen. 

Vika: Nobody wants an apple?

Ashley: I do. Thanks.

Oleg: О! Gotcha! Thank you!

Vika: Eleven fourteen //very dirty.

Oleg: //Gotcha – what does it mean? Gotcha.

Ashley: Gotha?

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: Oh, gotcha! 

00:16:00:13

Ashley: Gotcha! 

Will: “I got it”

Ashley: "Got it”, right. It’s a slang word. So what?

Vika: Oleg, what can you say about eleven fourteen? Can you clean it up?

Ashley: William, what are you at //eleven fourteen?

Will: Eleven fourteen? One minute. 

Vika: Yes. 

Ashley: //And, Salah, what do you think of eleven fourteen?

Vika: //Any losses?

Oleg: Yes, there will be losses, but, again, everything is being cleaned. Fine. 

Vika: Okay. 

Will: We lose almost everything. 98% water loss. 

Salah: [UI]

00:16:32:04

Ashley: Do I need to fix them and tell them it’s seventeen thirty-nine and not seventeen thirty-eight, that they should be looking at?

Will: Yes. 

00:16:07 -00:17:07:14

[no audio]

Vika: Can you [UI], right?

Oleg: Sure.

Ashley: Sure, Vika. If you want it so why not?

00:17:14:25- 00:17:23:20

[no audio]

Vika: Guys, do you want an apple?

Ashley: Silence. 

Vika: Alright. 

00:17:33:24 – 00:18:05:11

[no audio]

Oleg: In the center it is 6:44 am. 

Ashley: Early in the morning.

Oleg: Well, guys, apparently, had a rough morning. So…[UI] Let's work efficiently, fluid engineer. 

Salah: [UI]

00:18:40:27

Vika: Hello.

Oleg: Someone came. 

Ashley: Katya! 

Oleg: When will Katya write us?

Vika: I don't get a response from her either. And her mail does not come. 

00:19:14:16

Salah: Do you have apple? 

Vika: Hm?

Salah: Or can you bring the…food. 

Ashley: Do we have another point? Do we have another point that we can offer them?

Vika: Twenty-five three; nineteen thirty-five; sixteen eighteen; twenty two twelve. 

Oleg: Wow. 

Will: Nineteen thirty-five

Ashley: Vika, one by one! 

Vika: Okay. Twenty-two twenty. 

Will: Nineteen thirty-four, nineteen thirty-five. 

00:19:46:13

Ashley: Okay. One at a time. Twenty-two twenty, you said, Vika?

Vika: Six…

Ashley: Very bad!

Vika: Okay. Really?

Ashley: Wait. No. You said twenty-two twenty.

Vika: Twenty-two twelve. 

Ashley: Twelve!

Vika: Yeah.

Ashley: I’m sorry.

Vika: Twenty...twenteen…

Ashley: Twelve. 

Vika: Twelve. 

Ashley: That was cute. 

Salah: Okay, what’s the point?

Ashley: Twenty-two twelve.

00:20:14:14

Ashley: Uh-oh. 

Oleg: [UI]

Ashley: My program is …

Oleg: [UI]

Ashley: …Fucking up. 

Salah: It’s recording, yeah?

Ashley: Twenty-two twelve could work actually.

Will: Twenty-two twelve?

Vika: Yes.

00:20:45:00

Will: Let me see here. //Twenty-two twelve.

Ashley: //There are red zones. So, the weather leaves much to be desired, but it would go.

Will: Yeah, twenty-two twelve. There’s not…there is about a fifth of the water than all the other ones. 

Salah: And it’s too deep. 

Ashley: //He said, that…

Vika: //What is “fifth”?

Salah: Too deep.

Will: Well, like, one in five. How to say it correctly?

Ashley: Salah said it was too deep. 

Vika: Oh, okay.

Salah: It’s too deep. 

Ashley: Yeah. Too deep, he says.

Vika: Okay. //Sixteen eighteen.

Ashley: //So... Sixteen eighteen. Okay. We've already looked at it, haven’t we?

Vika: Yes!

Will: Sixteen eighteen?

Ashley: I like it.

00:21:15:27

Will: Maybe, but there's half the water. I mean, we want fifty thousand, but... how to call it? Of water...or how should it be measured? In liters or something. And there, in general, there are fifty thousand, but we want that fifty thousand to be used. There are only eighteen that we can use. So, it may work, but I don't know how others will accept this. I know for sure that...

00:21:45:10

Will: How is it called? Structural geologist would be like “No. ”

Vika: Mhm.

Ashley: Vika, you had another point too.

Vika: Nineteen thirty-five. 

Will: Nineteen thirty-five? Have you already said?

Vika: Mhm. 

Ashley: Yes. //Let’s have a look.

Will: //Nineteen thirty-five?

Vika: Yes.

Will: Seems fine. 

Vika: And twenty-five three. //These are the points I have.

Will: Twenty-five three? Half of what may be on the other, but yes, it is. 

Ashley: Twenty-five three?

00:22:15:06

Vika: Yes. 

Ashley: William, did you say it was good?

Will: This one would work. I don’t know.

Oleg: //[SL] Nineteen twenty-two is bad.

Ashley: //It would just be good for me. If it works for you, for Vika, for me... What about Oleg?

Oleg: Repeat once again. Which one?

Ashley: Twenty-five three. Twenty-five three?

Salah: Let me check. 

Vika: At nineteen thirty-four there was a high level of contamination. That's why…

Will: Nineteen thirty-four?

Vika: Yes. You just said. 

Oleg: No... no...

Vika: But nineteen thirty-five is fine. 

Salah: Twenty-five?

Ashley: Twenty-five three. 

00:22:50:08

Will: Twenty-five three.

Salah: It’s okay. Good. 

Ashley: Really? So, it’s four. Oleg, what did you say?

Oleg: One minute. I'll tell you now. 

Ashley: ‘Cause four of us here said that…

Vika: Oleg also said that it was normal. //That's why I...

Ashley: //You agree?

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: So we can...we say...//we'll tell them twenty-two...twenty-five three. Twenty-five three.

Vika: //Twenty-five three.

Oleg: Yes.

Vika: Alright. 

Will: I already offered them. I just....

Ashley: Suggest twenty-five three.

00:23:20:08

Salah: What’s your title? Your job here. 

Ashley: Hydrogeologist. She is. 

Salah: Hydro?

Ashley: Hydrogeologist…fifteen fifty-three Moscow time. 

Will: Eight twenty-nine, they say here. 

Vika: Yes.

Ashley: Eight twenty-nine?

Will: Yes. 

00:23:50:29

Ashley: There is something. Maybe. 

Vika: Contamination is high and water loss is massive. No. 

Oleg: Yes, if only there were no small ... No turbidity and impurities, then it would be generally superb. Or at least a little lower level of it. 

Will: There ain’t any water. 

Oleg: Why do we consider it then?

00:24:19:21

Salah: Which point we agreed on?

Ashley: Twenty-five three.

00:24:54:02

Ashley: And when you chat, are you only talking to your team or other people too?

Will: I always inform that I write to my operation specialist.

Ashley: Hm.

Oleg: What do you think about point thirty-eight eighteen?

Will: Thirty-eight eighteen.

Ashley: Thirty-eight what?

Oleg: Thirty-eight eighteen.

Ashley: Eighteen.

00:25:29:11

Will: There’s no water.

Oleg: Holy crap! 

Vika: [UI]

Oleg: I have almost everything there close to zero. The purest water. That ain’t there. 

Ashley: My team says nineteen thirty-four.

Vika: No. It wouldn’t work. 

Ashley: Thirty-four? Because we looked at thirty-five.

Vika: Yes. We have already checked thirty-four as well. It wouldn’t work. 

Will: Nineteen thirty-four?

Vika: Yes.

Will: What do you mean? Why?

00:25:59:09

Vika: Thirty....I’m sure. It wouldn’t work. Wait I’ll see why.

Will: There is so much water! //Nineteen thirty-four.

Vika: //Yes, but there, it seems, too high contamination level. 

Ashley: But it could be...

Vika: Just checked.

Will: But if there is so much water...

Ashley: How high? Because maybe we could clean it up. 

Vika: One minute.

Will: Because it is the biggest source for us. The biggest one indeed.

Ashley: Yes.

Will: So if there's a lot of water in there, then it's fine, like...

Vika: It is very good in terms of yield and loss, but //high level of contamination by small ...

Oleg: //I'm gonna check it. 

00:26:30:20

Ashley: Nineteen thirty-four…

Vika: //By small particles.

Will: //How high is it?

Vika: Oleg will tell if he can clean it. 

Oleg: And, in general, is it possible technically to do this or not.

Salah: Which one?

Ashley: We are discussing nineteen thirty-four because that’s what they sent us and…

Salah: I sent it to them. They discussed and asked.

Ashley: Nineteen thirty-four?

Salah: Yeah. Then, after we discuss with them, they ask me regarding the brand and the drill. 

Ashley: So, //should we send them this?

Oleg: //[UI]

Salah: So, I answered them… 

00:27:01:07

Will: //Nuggets. 

Ashley: //She said there is high contamination. 

Oleg: //I will do it. 

Salah: Yeah. Then //she said that there was high contamination.  

Vika: //Nineteen thirty-four. 

Will: What kind of?

Vika: Guys, nineteen…

Oleg: Nineteen thirty-four //can be cleared. 

Vika: //thirty-four.

Ashley: //Nineteen thirty-four. Yeah.

Vika: Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Will: Shit!

Vika: What’s up? Oh! Can I tag everyone at once? Or not? Okay.

Oleg: This is your questionnaire.

Vika: So what? We do it with everyone.

Oleg: Yes. 

00:27:30:04

Ashley: I give the same answers to the questions almost every time. 

Oleg: In fact, we are discussing it among us.

Ashley: Yes. 

Oleg: And we have our own team.

00:27:45:29 – 00:28:35:04

[no audio]

Ashley: So my team chose our first offer — seventeen thirty nine...

Oleg: Thirty-eight.

Ashley: We changed it to thirty-nine because William said it was better. They said it was a good option for them. 

Vika: And the last one is nineteen thirty-four?

Ashley: It works for them too, but nineteen thirty-four — the weather is worse there. There are big red zones. 

00:29:05:22

Vika: Okay.

Ashley: So what?

Vika: And the previous?

Ashley: Seventeen thirty-nine //much better.

Vika: //I haven't checked yet. One minute. 

Will: Which is better?

Ashley: Seventeen thirty-nine is much better for me. 

Will: Seventeen thirty-nine?

Ashley: The one we discussed at the beginning.

Will: Seventeen thirty-nine?

Ashley: Yeah. 

00:29:30:23

Will: Okay. I’ve already got it. 

Vika: For some reason I don't have that point.

Oleg: Okay. Turbidity is eighty. 

Will: That’s it!

Ashley: Really?

Will: Yeah, I mean, it’s passable for me. 

Vika: Seventeen thirty-nine?

Ashley: Yes.

Will: Yeah. Do they say seventeen thirty-nine?

Ashley: Yeah. 

Oleg: Yes. //Possibly.

Ashley: //So, my team is saying, “Seventeen thirty-nine is// a good option. It seems to work for us, and…”

Vika: //Why are we listening to them?

Salah: Which one?

Ashley:// Seventeen thirty-nine, that we said earlier on. That you said that it was good for you too. 

Oleg: //Contamination, impurities. I have one filter which can remove it all.

Vika: Oh really?

Oleg: Yes. 

Ashley: So is it okay or not?

Oleg: Yes, yes, yes.

Ashley: Yes. He is good. 

Oleg: It will be at the limit.

Ashley: Is it really deep for you?

Salah: Still, I didn’t check for it. 

00:30:00:00

Ashley: Seventeen thirty-nine. That might be the one that we converge on.

Will: He said it was deep, but he said that it was okay. 

Ashley: Yep.

Vika: There will be a massive water loss. Is there enough water, Will?

Will: What?

Oleg: Does seventeen thirty-nine possess a decent amount of water?

Will: Yes, yes, yes. 

Vika: Ah, it’s okay. The loss is within the norm. The loss is fine.

00:30:31:24

Vika: //Yes. Okay. Seventeen thirty-nine.

Ashley: //So, maybe we could…Sorry. One of my specialists says that at seventeen thirty-nine it is impossible to fully eliminate…

Will: Huh?

Ashley: Eliminate. How do you say it?

Will: What...what…

Ashley: There is no way to completely eliminate contamination with filters and materials at seventeen thirty-nine. 

Will: To filter contamination.

Oleg: We have a method. We really do.

Vika: He is unde....

Oleg: The thing is...

Will: Yeah.

00:31:00:11

Oleg: You can write to him that the H filters of the third stage allow you to clean up to 85%. 

Ashley: Can you repeat it once again?

Oleg: Filters of the group H allow to clean the water up to 85%.

Ashley: Filter H…

Oleg: Up to 85%.

Ashley: …can clean up to 80%? Eighty?

Oleg: And five. 

Ashley: 85%.

00:31:31:05

Ashley: But how much do we need?

Oleg: The less the better.

Ashley: Is it a drinking water if it's eighty-five or not?

Oleg: Drinking water is zero. It means it’s pure.

Ashley: I see. Zero means drinking water. So, eighty-five is definitely not for drinking.

Oleg: Well, of course. That's what it's filtered for.

Ashley: So if you clean it up to eighty-five, then there are 15% left to get drinking water.

Oleg: No. There are filters that will allow you to do this to zero. 

Ashley: Mhm. 

00:32:00:04

Oleg: But at the same time, losses will be up to 60%. Since the maximum value of the filters.

Ashley: So, at seventeen thirty-nine, you can only clean up to 85%.

Oleg: Yes. 

Ashley: So it’s not the best point. 

Oleg: Obviously it’s not. But technically it is possible.

00:32:35:27

Vika: No. 

Will: May I have some fruits?

Vika: Sure. Do we have some? Would you like nuts?

Will: Is there no fruit?

Vika: There are dried apples. There is a whole apple. 

00:33:01:19

Vika: Do you want me to cut it?

Will: Twenty-five three. No, thanks. It’s fine. 

Vika: And why eighteen thirty-nine... twenty-five three?

Oleg: What about seventeen... It can be cleansed. 

Vika: No, I mean...Will...

Oleg: Is there any water?

00:33:32:14

Vika: Damn, why are we so stupid today?

Will: Fifty fifty-three? 

Vika: Repeat once again. What was the last point you mentioned?

Will: What do you mean?

Vika: Twenty-five thirty-nine? Twenty-five three? Which one?

Will: Hm? What? What you are trying to say?

Vika: What was the last point you named? 

00:34:01:12

Will: I don’t know. Look it up in the chat. I posted a lot. 

Oleg: They are looking at twenty-five three. 

Will: Yes. 

Salah: I’m sorry, which one?

Oleg: We have considered it before.

Salah: Twenty-five three? Who said it before?

Ashley: I did...Why?

Salah: Because they are asking about it. [UI]

00:34:31:04

Salah: [SL]Here. [UI]

Will: Great.

Vika: Five thousand. 

Ashley: So, twenty-five three. Remind me, was that good for everyone here?

Will: It was alright. It’s not the best for me, but…

Vika: Yeah. We can do that.

Will: Other people in the geology team can handle it. We can handle it. 

00:35:06:01

Oleg: They are looking at us right now and like “Ahh! They eat!”

Will: Like, “What the hell is wrong with that guy?”

00:35:30:06

Will: I’d love to see both teams on, like, a big screen with all six going. 

Ashley: Yeah. So, we can see where everyone’s looking; what are they thinking. 

Will: And sync the time. 

Ashley: That would be really cool. 

Vika: Hm…//nuts are here. You want?

Ashley: //These are the last! …There is a prune. I see that Oleg has already eaten everything. 

Will: What are you doing?

Oleg: And someone hadn't. 

00:36:00:03

Will: You hid it from me!

Oleg: Someone is too slow.

Will: What are you doing?

Ashley: Nothing left for Ashley. Oleg ate everything. 

Vika: [UI]

Oleg: That's it. 

Vika: Did you see our schedule?

Ashley: Oh, man! I, actually [UI]

Oleg: Ashley missed it again. 

00:36:30:13

Vika: Working.

Ashley: Man!

Will: Om-nom-nom. 

Vika: This thing with nuts is very tasty. Honestly, try it! 

Will: I do not want. 

Vika: [UI]

Oleg: Yes. You’ve missed it. 

Vika: While we are on the Project RED we eat most of the time.

00:36:59:10

Ashley: My team rate twenty-five three as good.

Vika: What about seventeen thirty-nine?

Ashley: Eighteen thirty-nine?

Vika: Seventeen thirty-nine.

Ashley: Seventeen thirty-nine. They said it's not bad, but they know that... well, if all the contamination is too high...

Vika: Oh, the sedimentologist answered to me. 

Oleg: Mhm.

Will: Okay. Yes. They can’t...

00:37:32:05

Vika: Hm?

Will: Nineteen thirty-four. 

Vika: Okay. Then we have seventeen thirty-nine.

Salah: No more?

Vika: Or twenty-five three.

Ashley: For nineteen thirty-four – no.

Will: Nineteen thirty-four is out. 

Salah: Out, and twenty-five three?

Will: They haven’t given us a word on that.

Ashley: My group seems to think it’s okay, and I like it too. What about you?

Salah: Yeah. I did the calculation and sent it to them. I’m waiting for their reply now. If they say “okay”, maybe we’ll agree on the point. 

Ashley: Sounds good.

00:38:04:05

Oleg: Nineteen thirty-four?

Ashley: We said that nineteen thirty-four wouldn’t work. 

00:38:11:21 – 00:38:31:25

[no audio]

Oleg: Here's a plus sign, right?

00:38:35:11 – 00:38:43:01

[no audio]

Vika: Mechanical engineer or…

Ashley: Materials.

Vika: Materials. Okay. That’s what I thought actually... Seventeen thirty-nine works for ours too.

Will: Seventeen thirty-nine — it’s true. 

Salah: Twenty-five three, yeah?

Vika: Seventeen thirty-nine. 

Ashley: So, these are the two top runners basically. Seventeen thirty-nine and twenty-five three. It seems. 

Oleg: Seventeen thirty-nine — yes. 

00:39:15:06

Oleg: It’s not the best but still could work. 

Salah: Did you check the last…//do you have the last page?

Vika://Damn it. 

Salah: Guys, do you have this page? Can you check?

Oleg: Page number?

Salah: Yeah. This one. The last. Because…when you check…

Ashley: Oh!

Salah: You didn’t know?

Ashley: No. But it follows what I was thinking. Yeah, so. It’s okay. 

00:39:45:15

Vika: About what?

Salah: //Last page, also…

Ashley: //On the last... On the last page, there are //some good suggestions.

Oleg: //Hints?

Salah: Yeah. Because when you calculate, you have to compare here.

Vika: Yeah. 

Salah: You see if this is good or not good. 

Ashley: Yeah. That’s fine.

00:40:01:21 – 00:40:37:23

[no audio]

Vika: That's awful! Yikes! Who wants?

Oleg: Ash?

Ashley: No. [UI]

Oleg: You will later say that you missed it again ... or you were cheated. And go to Lyosha to complain. 

Vika: Who? Oops! Ohh it’s so pleasant.
00:41:08:00

Oleg: And got angry like that…[UI]

Ashley: Careful. There’s a… 

Vika: Oopie.

Ashley: Vika! 

Vika: Sorry!

Oleg: Ash, you're being recorded. America is watching you. 

Ashley: //Everyone is watching and hearing this. 

Vika: //So what?

Oleg: It’s fine.

Vika: It’s real life. 

00:41:36:22

Salah: Sign off?

Ashley: [SL] In a bit. You’re here, like, “I’m ready.”

Oleg: They look at you from Chicago, and you ...

Salah: Chicago.

Vika: Chicago. 

00:42:00:06

Vika: We need to see it today too.

00:42:27:16

Ashley: Okay. They confirmed that there are seventeen thirty-nine. So...

Oleg: Let’s keep it.

Ashley: Let’s...

Will: Okay.

Salah: Which one?

Ashley: So, I think we all agree on seventeen thirty-nine. 

Vika: So…

Will: I think, the structural geologist has to put…

Oleg: Seventeen thirty-nine. 

00:43:01:17

Salah: It’s not the best option…It’s good. 

Ashley: Come on! We have to get all of us agreeing. 

Salah: Now you see, huh?

Vika: What’s that?

Will: Fuck.

Vika: What’s that?

Will: //[UI]

Salah: //When I’m putting…

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: //I wrote, and there was a glitch and that is what happened.

Salah: //[UI]. The equipment cost per hour for this one is three hundred, so it’s high. //It’s a good option, it’s not the best. 

Ashley: //Well let me what see my stuff here is. So what do I want to put in here?

00:43:30:11

Ashley: So, hygiene decision. So, seventeen //thirty-nine.

Oleg: //I can clean it up. So what? Do we agree with seventeen thirty-nine?

Vika: It is clear to whom it all became even more interesting.

Ashley: [SL] Okay, Twenty-seven, so…

Oleg: I want at least one positive.

Vika: No, I want //to send letters already.

Ashley: //That’s about two thousand, I would say, impacts hygiene training, so let’s put it as a…

Oleg: //Okay.

00:44:01:21

Oleg: It all starts.

Ashley: Six. 

Vika: Do they see us? Or not?

Oleg: Who? Chicago?

Vika: Yes.

Oleg: No. 

Vika: Okay. 

Salah: [UI]

Ashley: Usability…Got it yellow. Here, a thousand. 

00:44:29:04

Ashley: [UI], less than a mile…

Vika: What are you thinking about?

Ashley: Seventeen thirty-nine. I’m just thinking of my specific values to put in.

Vika: Oh. Now?

Oleg: Please check one twenty-eight.

Ashley: Which one?

Vika: Is this your point or your friends?

Oleg: No, it's mine. 

Ashley: Oleg!

Oleg: [UI]

Ashley: It's already time for us to connect.

Oleg: So, well, that's it.

Ashley: And what do you want?

00:44:59:16

Oleg: I agree with seventeen thirty-nine. Yeah... but I suggest another one, one twenty-eight. 

Ashley: One...One?

Oleg: One twenty-eight.

Ashley: Twenty-eight.

Vika: // It’s fine. But I think that there will be not enough water. 

Ashley: Not bad, but the population to be able to live there is very small. 

Vika: Very little water. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: Well, that's all then. Seventeen thirty...

Ashley: That’s all!

Oleg: Look here, Ash. Ash. 

00:45:30:07

Ashley: I see.

Oleg: I'm already //like this, you know, like this - "trrr-tt-trr-tt" 

Vika: Losses are decent. 

Ashley: Sniper. 

Oleg: Yes. You’re a sniper. 

Ashley: Okay. So, seventeen thirty-nine is…

Oleg: Well... Shall we choose this one?

Ashley: …one…distance of one. So, it’s one yellow zone. Distance less than a mile, so that’s okay. 

00:46:02:02

Ashley: [UI] affects usability…Low, put that as a three. Maintenance…[UI]. Ope, zero there…so…

Will: What are they waiting for?

Ashley: [UI]Four…hygiene, hygiene. Two.

00:46:29:05

Ashley: It costs twice as much as allowed but that’s okay, because we’re going to have to pull that [UI]

Oleg: How can the map be enlarged?

Salah: Which point?

Ashley: [UI]

Salah: Which point are you talking about, guys?

Ashley: We are still talking…We are all just agreeing on seventeen thirty-nine and deciding on our values for what to put for our individual stuff. So, let’s see. If I put…

00:47:03:04

Ashley: [UI]

Oleg: One thirty is simply superb. Where the purest water goes. 

Ashley: Red zone…

Vika: One thirty or one twenty-eight?

Oleg: One thirty.

00:47:19:06 – 00:47:39:23

[no audio]

Oleg: There are really great places...

00:47:45:24 – 00:48:29:02

[no audio]

Salah: Seems that the guy who is working as a drilling specialist didn’t read the manual. He is just copying and sending answers.

 Will: Well, yeah, but I mean remember how it was when we first started doing it too.

Salah: Yeah. 

Will: If he is new, he has no clue what the hell he is doing. 

Salah: Because I’m giving him some options of which is good quality. 

Will: Mhm.

Salah: He is telling me drilling method, which is the worst one. 

Will: Yeah. Well, I mean, you got used to working with Katya. 

00:48:59:07

Salah: It’s so weird. He doesn’t understand. 

Will: But Katya was injured in a freak drilling accident. So now, she’s getting her arm repaired.

Salah: For humanity to Mars. 

Will: Yeah. 

Oleg: This one is generally gorgeous — two forty-five. I think everyone will like it. 

Ashley: Oleg is still ... looking for? Looking for.

Will: Which one?

Vika: //Two forty-five.

Oleg: //Two forty-five. 

00:49:30:11

Ashley: What is it?

Will: Twenty forty-five. 

Ashley: Twenty...

Vika: //Two forty-five.

Oleg: //Two forty-five. 

Ashley: Two...

Oleg: Forty-five.

Ashley: Forty-five.

Vika: It’s fine basically. 

Ashley: For me it’s fine too. Maybe even better. 

Oleg: Well, just, if on those, then we will lose sixty percent. 

Will: Damn! Now one of them is saying,

00:49:59:20

Will: “Nineteen thirty-four and twenty-five three are the best options”.  But now I’m confused. 

Ashley: Oh, my people were saying that seventeen thirty-nine. 

Will: I know. One of them was, too. Maybe this is just a delayed message.

Ashley: Maybe. Because ours said, “Seventeen thirty-nine is greater than -- twenty-five thirty is greater than nineteen thirty-four.”

Salah: You know, it’s the chain. If I’m in here…if I’m agreeing on my team, they will send it to your team. And they will send it to theirs.

00:50:30:10 – 00:51:09:10

[no audio] 

Vika: Oleg, are you still looking?

Oleg: No. I answer. I was given three options. 

Will: This means that they are discussing, and it is not clear to them what to choose. So, I now asked operations if they actually chose or not.

00:51:32:06 – 00:52:08:06

[no audio]

Vika: What?

Ashley: I think it’s delayed, because I sent them my decisions for training and then they, like, “What are your decisions?”. I’m, like, “I just sent them to you.” The delay! Although, six-minute delay is no comparison to our one-week delay for…

00:52:31:05

Will: Fuck! 

Vika: Yeah. So, did you receive some messages?

Ashley: I got something today, yeah. 

Vika: From past, or…

Ashley: No. Actually, it was on time. I think they sent it this morning, so. 

Vika: Okay. 

Ashley: But still…I mean everybody else. 

00:52:51:26 – 00:53:15:02

[no audio]

Vika: What’s up? What have you got?

Oleg: Twenty-five thirty is too...

Vika: Thirty? Not three?

Oleg: Three. Three. 

Will: Okay! Put the coordinates there, please! I want to continue. 

Vika: Will, wanna some nuts?

00:54:06:22

Salah: Which point? They are discussing about seventeen thirty-nine. 

Ashley: I think so. 

Will: Oh, wait. Hold up. Something…

Ashley: Uh-oh. What?

Will: Fluid engineer is going nuts. //Fluid engineer started trying to…

Ashley: //Fluid engineer. What’s up with the engineering team? Come on!

Will: What are they trying to do with my guy? Okay. Structural.

Salah: It has been reset by it? 

Ashley: Okay. //Oh, I didn’t even know that it was already…

Will: //Yeah, because the fluid…fluid…No, no. Fluid boy started smashing the signoff button. 

Ashley: Oh. 

00:54:37:23

Will: Instead of…

Oleg: So, what are we going to choose?

Will: //We're just waiting for them to put a point there.

Salah: //What should we actually do to be signing off?

Ashley: I think that they have to decide on their side.

Oleg: I have the same percentage everywhere. I use maximum filters everywhere.

Will: Then just sit and wait until... If you've already set your things, you've already set them. If not, then we wait.

Oleg: The thing is that where it is clean, there is no water. Where there is water, it is muddy everywhere and this is the maximum filtration. 

00:55:09:09

Oleg: There will be losses anyway. 

Vika: Does everybody fill out already?

00:55:33:01

Oleg: Are you filling out?

Ashley: They said that maintenance filters are A, D and H for stage one, two and three. If that means anything to you, guys. For me it does, so, A, D, H.

Oleg: No one has filled out for me yet. 

00:56:14:06

Vika: Five minute delay, right?

Oleg: Three. 

Ashley: Three to one side. 

Oleg: They are at seventeen thirty-nine. 

00:56:34:05 – 00:56:50:01

[no audio]

Vika: It seems to me that it can simply be called “struck”.

Will: Okay. We need to wait.

00:57:05:11 – 00:57:19:28

[no audio]

Vika: Nuts? You want?

Ashley: One moment. I’ve got to get my stuff in. 

Will: I guess it’s already in there.

Ashley: Yeah. It looks like my team entered the things for me. That I had mentioned in the chat.

00:57:50:27

Vika: That’s it? Have we chosen this point? That’s it. Great. 

Oleg: Which one? Which one?

Will: Seventeen thirty-nine. Okay. We’re making good progress. Let’s get it. Let’s get it!

Salah: Which one?

Will: We are ready to sign off. Did you get everything filled in? You ready to go to sign off?

Vika: How did you do it?

Will: What do you mean?

Vika: How did you put that point?

Will: Which one? It’s they who did.

Ashley: They did it. 

Vika: Oh, okay. 

Salah: So, we should fill it?

Ashley: Yeah, if you are ready to sign off. 

00:58:21:27

Ashley: They probably filled it in based on the chat stuff.

Vika: Oh, drilling specialist…specialist. 

Ashley: Manuel Alger. 

Vika: What?

Ashley: It says Manuel Alger but, like, I was trying to make it funny, like it’s a name.

Vika: Alright. Funny.

Ashley: It wasn’t funny at all. 

Salah: So, which point they chose?

Ashley: Seventeen thirty-nine. 

Vika: Sign. 

Oleg: What?

Vika: Sign. 

00:58:50:00

Oleg: Now I will choose which filter is better. 

Ashley: You can’t choose anymore. There is already. 

Vika: It seems to be filled in automatically. 

Oleg: Mhm.

Ashley: They gave A, D, H. 

Will: Oleg, have you pressed yet?

Oleg: Not yet. …Now I will choose.

Salah: I signed off. 

Ashley: Me too. 

Salah: Who still…

Oleg: Did you do it?

Ashley: Mhm.

00:59:24:06

Vika: Weee! 

Ashley: Oh, fuck! Did I not? 

Vika: What? What?

Ashley: I thought I did but I couldn’t. Do you guys see me signed off or no?

Salah: No.

Will: Looks like it’s…I think we’re good. 

Salah: We are doing…

Will: Alright, and which one do we…which survey do we have to fill out now?

Salah: No survey. 

Ashley: There is always a survey after. 

Salah: [UI]

Ashley: There is a survey. 

Will: Yeah.

Salah: Forty-five? Forty-five is after TTB.

Ashley: Hang on. 

Vika: We can close it, can we?

Ashley: “Once you finish the Design task, complete survey DeСhurch…”

Salah: Done.

Vika: Good for you. Ha-ha. I like surveys very much.

Salah: Now, if you go back to the...

Ashley: Ha-ha. 

Salah: Huh?

Vika: // Ha-ha.

Ashley: //We need to concentrate. 

Oleg: // A little bit of everything. 

Ashley: // Ha-ha.

Salah: And you are finished with this one? 

Ashley: Uh-huh.

Vika: Ha-ha.

Oleg: Are you also finished?

Ashley: No, not yet. 

Oleg: And why?

Ashley: //Let me… let me concentrate...

00:04:32:13

Vika: //Live normally…

Will: Don’t turn your camera off and just make sure you take that with you. Or you can leave it here if you don’t want them to hear you pee. 

Ashley: //Ha-ha.

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley: //Ha-ha. Yes.

Vika: Cast off moorings! 

Ashley: //Ha-ha. Yes. Can’t concentrate here.

Oleg: //Read carefully.

Ashley: //Ha-ha.

Oleg: What shall we do next? Turn on the audio?

00:05:01:16

Ashley: No.

Vika: No.

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Will: [sneezes]

Vika: Bless you!

Ashley: Bless you!

Oleg: Grow big and strong!

Vika: //Yes, do grow strong! Please! Don’t give me any work.

00:05:31:07

Vika: [Whispering, UI] 

Oleg: Do you like it when such a signature appears?

Vika: I love completing surveys. I like it very much.

Oleg: //How will you live without surveys in your future life?

Vika: Don’t know how I will live…

Oleg: // Ha-ha.

Vika: …survey without you.

00:06:01:18

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Vika: Ha-ha.

Ashley: He will think that I am just laughing at myself.

Vika: It’ll be so. 

Oleg: Be sure of that. They will understand you.

Vika: But it’s not certain.

00:06:41:18

Vika: Ha-ha. 

Ashley: Oh my God, I’ve completed Section 1, now there is Section 2.

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: //Ha-ha.

Will: I don’t know how you’ve already finished.

Ashley: //Yeah. I also don’t… Ha-ha

00:07:02:07

Vika: Clever balls. Ha-ha.

Ashley: Ha-ha. 

Vika: Oh guys, we are waiting for you, all together.

Ashley: Shhh. Ha-ha.

Oleg: We had fewer questions.

Ashley: [UI]

00:07:33:11

Vika: What’s happening? What’s going on here? Maybe in the meantime we can fill out something, some other survey. Where is it? We have a whole bunch today.

Oleg: Yes. 

Vika: Also [UI] do it there. 

00:08:01:01

Ashley: Don’t forget that it is a relay task now.

VIka: Huh?

Ashley: We have one more task.

Vika: Yeah.

Ashley:  Don’t forget. Okay. Ha-ha.

Vika: We are waiting for you, Ashley. 

Ashley: Oh sorry. Ha-ha.

Oleg: Go ahead and fill it out.

Ashley: Ha-ha.

Oleg: //Are you done already?

Vika: //Excuse me.

Ashley: I’ve finished.

Oleg: Are you turning it off?

Ashley: //No, of course not? We still have another task.

Vika: //No, not yet. We have another task. Who will be sending letters? Who will be the mailman? Olga Ivanovna?

Ashley: Relay task. 

00:08:29:27

Ashley: Reynold said to tell everyone exactly this: “You can’t speak in the relay task. And you can’t look at anything.”

Vika: Can we write things down?

Ashley: No, you can’t. Nothing.

Oleg: //And I can see that you wrote it down.

Ashley: Okay. Sorry. Ha-ha.

Oleg: Why is this lying around here? There, all of it.

Vika: Ha-ha.

Ashley: And you?

Oleg: This isn’t mine.

Ashley: Ah! Okay. Ha-ha.

Will: //Fuck. What the fuck?

Oleg: Do you see the cheat sheets? See? A cheat sheet is there.

Ashley: Hmm.

Oleg: Yes.

00:09:01:04

Ashley: Oh!

Oleg: Why, why? 

Ashley: Okay, so, relay relay. 

Oleg: So, we are now opening the next one, yes?  

Ashley: Uh-huh.

00:09:27:14 – 00:09:44:28

[no audio]

Oleg: This is Relay, yes?

Ashley: Uh-huh.

00:10:13:12

Salah: So, the next one.

Ashley: I was telling them, Reynold said that we can’t talk at all during this one.

Salah:  And this one? 

Ashley: Uh-huh. And no notes.

Salah: Ah!

Vika: I can’t believe this!

Ashley: I am waiting for you. 

Oleg: Next?

Ashley: You can already choose those two.

00:10:45:06

Oleg: I have already chosen.

Ashley: Uh-huh. You can…

Will: //I am looking at this one, it is all about… does it work well or not?

Ashley: //Oh, now we will have 91. Ha-ha.

Vika: Yes. It’s just off a little bit. No, it’s okay.

Oleg: Okay. Let’s start. Let’s start. 

00:11:15:12

Oleg: There is a message… Please!

Vika: Oh.

Will: Die quickly.

Vika: Cast off the moorings! 

00:11:43:19

Oleg: Are you recording the music?

Will: Oooh!

Vika: Oooh!

Ashley: Oh my God.

Oleg: Can you imagine the conclusions that they will draw after…

Will: Well, it’s 7 a.m. there, or close to that. They must be doing some weird stuff there, too. There will probably be a video of some a student who is watching like...

00:12:16:09

Vika: Let’s ask them to record some video for us.

Will: Yes. We need to say to them something like, “Hi! My name is William. I am your sedimentologist.”

Ashley: I want to meet these people.

Will: Uh-huh.

Ashley: I’m going to hang out in Chicago and be like, “yo Northwest-nerds!”

Will: This what is coming to you.

00:12:47:14

Will: I’m trying to hit the town. //Real quick, real quick.

Ashley: //Let’s go from here.

Vika: There, take it. Ah, sorry, I can’t.

Oleg: [UI]. 

Vika: Perfect evening. 

00:13:17:19

Will: Uh-huh, it will be like that.

Ashley: Hungry! Ha-ha.

Oleg: Somebody has arrived! Ha-ha.

Will: Even without Spirulina. 

Oleg: Yes.

Ashley:  Ha-ha.

Oleg: //The return of spirulina.

Vika: We have a case. But we can grow our own.

Oleg: Today I sent off twenty dark pieces there. 

Will: Twenty kilos of poop. Ha-ha.

Vika: Ha-ha. It’s so funny that I feel like using the bathroom just a bit.

00:13:44:26

Will: What?

Vika: Done… Oh! Oh!

Salah: I guess if there... hmm... I mean, [SL] if the letter “R,” they admit it. I mean, I cannot forward it to anyone.

Ashley: Only the two that you have selected. What do you mean?

Salah: I mean, okay. 

00:14:14:12

Salah: This is something related to my career, I mean. What should I do?

Ashley: You got to... you can only relay it to the two people that you chose. 

Salah: That’s it, that?

Ashley: Uh-huh.

Will: //Well, you won’t... if it’s... if it’s actually related, it’s actually for you, you won’t see it.

Ashley: //If it’s actually for you, then it will actually be destination “you.” And it would come here.

Salah: Yeah, yeah. Ah, okay.

Ashley: You’ve got a lot coming in. I got nothing.

00:14:44:00

Vika: Hmm. Ha-ha.

Oleg: What’s up with mechanical? Just sitting there.

00:15:23:20

Will: Wow!

Ashley: You can really dance

Will: Mmm.

Ashley: Mmm.

Vika: Mhm.

Oleg: Today there is no progress. Works badly. They must have hired Olga Ivanovna.

Will: Uh-huh.

Ashley: Whoever the Fluid Engineer is, is sure sending me a lot of stuff.

Will: Good job, Fluid Engineer. 

00:15:56:26

Ashley: Great job, Fluid. I like you. Ha-ha.

Oleg: That’s it, three… three complete.

00:16:34:22

Will: Yeehaw!

Vika: Ha-ha.

Oleg: Where did you put it?

Vika: Damn, why can’t we write things down? Hmm.

00:16:58:01

Oleg: Fluid really? From him… just pushing it off. Mechanical is just sleeping there.

00:17:11:04 – 00:21:00:17

[no audio]

Will: Got ‘em. Okay. Let’s move on. 

Oleg: Okay!

Will: Beep-boop.

00:21:31:11

Ashley: Do you guys always pick the same people for the second round or do you...?

Will: I normally mix it up.

Ashley: I mix it up, too.

Vika: Yes, me too.

Ashley: Get going. Okay.

00:22:14:16

Vika: Katya wrote to me. Ha-ha. No, it’s not funny.

Oleg: Wrote?

Will: Fuck.

Vika: Bless you!

Salah: Bless you!

Oleg: Thank you! Did she write really?

Vika: No.

Oleg: Not true? 

Vika: No.

00:22:45:25

Oleg: And you, look here, Olga Ivanovna isn’t working at this hour.

00:22:51:26 – 00:23:19:25

[no audio]

Salah: It’s something better [SL].

Vika: I don’t remember these connections. It’s hard for me. I probably need to learn all these positions. I do not even know.

00:23:54:14

Vika: Okay?

Salah: Close your eyes.

Vika: Ha-ha. In the right order! Ha-ha.

Oleg: Connectivity today is unfortunately not good.

00:24:18:14 – 00:26:04:26

[no audio]

Oleg: [UI]

Salah: Ha-ha.

00:26:24:22

Salah: This message is for you.

Will: Thank you!

Salah: Ha-ha.

Vika: Ha-ha. Wow, wow, wow!

Oleg: Careful. Careful.

Ashley: Ho! Ho! Ho!

Vika: Easy there!

00:26:34:25 – 00:30:29:13

[no audio]

Vika: Mhm.

00:30:34:06 – 00:31:21:29

[no audio]

Salah: Nine seconds … three, two, one.

Ashley: Happy New Year!

Salah: Ha-ha.

Vika: Yeah!

Salah: We are done!

Will: All right!

Vika: That’s it, we can turn off the video.

Salah: //After two weeks Project RED again.

Will: //Now, we turn off the video.

Vika: Yes.

Will: Video off.
