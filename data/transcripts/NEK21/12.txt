Will: Camera recording. 

Oleg: There.

Ashley: Everyone?

Will: Yep.

Ashley: Alright. 

Salah: Yep. 

Ashley: Today is March 29, 2022. It’s mission day 145. The time is 2:39PM. Three, two, one. //Mark.

All: //Mark. 

Oleg: Mark. 

Will: Okay. Sixteen twenty-one. Sixteen twenty-one. 
00:00:34:28

Oleg: And look at sixteen forty, too.

Salah: Who said sixteen twenty?

Will: Sixteen twenty-one. I said. I said. 

Salah: Mhm.

Vika: Yuck.

Salah: Sixteen

Will: Twenty-one…

Vika: What is this? 

Ashley: Mediocre for me. 

Vika: Mine doesn’t want.

Oleg: A bit deep, of course, but…

Ashley: It could work, but, mediocre. 

Will: Okay. 

Vika: I am rebooting because I am having problems.

00:00:59:19

Oleg: Look at sixteen forty too, just in case,

Ashley: Sixteen forty?

Will: Sixteen forty?

Oleg: Yes. 

Ashley: Oh, that…that’s pretty good. 

Will: No water. 

Salah: Sixteen…

Will: Without water.

Ashley: Oh. Without water. Never mind. 

Salah: Check…

Vika: It’s not working for me.

Salah: Thirty-eight…no, this is…

Oleg: Okay. 

Vika: I’ve already done this.

Will: Do it again. 

Vika: Okay, okay. 

00:01:30:25

Oleg: It’s…everything. Okay. Salah, and the fact that the depth…depth…

Salah: What is it?

Oleg:  One thousand. It’s sixteen twenty-one. The depth is one thousand two hundred – is it okay for you?

Salah: It’s okay. 

Vika: There’s nothing. 

00:01:58:17

Salah: Check eighteen thirty-seven. 

Ashley: Eighteen thirty-seven. 

Will: Not great but it’s got some water. 

Ashley: I mean, yeah, it’s alright for me…What do you guys think about eleven forty-six? 

00:02:31:25
Ashley: Eleven forty-six. 

Will: One minute. 

Vika: I’ve rebooted and still I can’t log in. I am rebooting the computer. 

Salah: Okay. 

Ashley: You like it? It’s okay?

00:03:00:01

Ashley: //Eleven…

Oleg: //There will be great losses. 

Ashley: Ah.

Oleg: Well, if there’s a lot of water, it’s possible.

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: I have losses…

Will: Which one?

Ashley: Eleven forty-six. 

Will: Eleven forty-six …Not so much water. 

Ashley: Mhm.

Will: But there is some. 

Oleg: There will be 60% loss. 

00:03:29:14

Will: There is 80% loss here, on my end of things, too. So, there’s very little. 

Oleg: Your point doesn’t work. 

Ashley: Okay, okay. 

Vika: Boo. 

Oleg: [SL] Remove it.

Ashley: I’ll find a different one. 

Vika: [UI]

Oleg: Last time, it worked for you more or less. 

Ashley: Yes. 

00:03:58:00

Salah: Thirty twenty-eight. 

Will: Okay. They are saying forty-three twenty. 

Ashley: I liked yours, by the way. 

Salah: Okay?

Ashley: Forty-three twenty? //So, they are saying forty-three twenty. Okay.

Will: //And thirty-five forty-four. 

00:04:29:09

Ashley: And what else? What was the second one you said, Will?

Will: Hold on.

Oleg: Oh, no. No, no, no.

Will: Forty-three twenty and thirty-five forty-four.

Oleg: Forty-three twenty – it’s very dirty. That is, the loss will be phenomenal. 

Vika: Phenomenal. 

Salah: So, Oleg said “No”.

Ashley: For forty-three twenty. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: But…

Salah: What’s the other one?

Ashley: Thirty-five forty-four? Right?

Will: Yes. 

00:04:57:28

Ashley: Oh! That’s a nice one, actually. It’s not bad. Reaching eight thousand five hundred people. That is massive. That is a lot. 

Will: Yeah, but there is 95% water loss. 

Salah: It’s good for me. 

Ashley: What about the one that Salah had said earlier? Thirty twenty-eight. What did you say about that?

Will: I didn’t check that one yet. 

00:05:18:08 – 00:05:50:11

[no audio]

Salah: Thirty twenty-eight, huh?

00:05:53:21 – 00:06:30:28

[no audio]

Vika: Twenty-one sixteen, yes? Did we start with that?

Oleg: Sixteen twenty-one. And, if possible, look at forty-five forty. 

Ashley: Forty-five forty. 

Salah: Will.

Will: Yeah. 

Salah: You still calculating?

Will: No, I’m answering stuff. 

Vika: No, it doesn’t work. 

Salah: Which one, Vika?

00:06:58:27

Ashley: She is having issues with her interface. 

Oleg: Do you have //[UI]?

Salah: //Camera?

Ashley: For you…no, it’s her interface. It’s not working.

Oleg: Yes. 

Ashley: She is not able to click on points. 

Salah: Mhm.

Ashley: It’s even okay. Not the best, but okay. 

Oleg: Well, I hope that...

Ashley: Maybe. 

Oleg: If there’s water there, then…Help yourself. 

Will: Okay, what was the one, Salah?

Salah: Thirty twenty-eight. 

00:07:30:24

Will: No water. 

Salah: I was waiting for you all the time. 

Will: I mean, I’ve verified another one of your points. 

Salah: Yeah. Okay, okay. 

Oleg: Forty-five forty.

Will: Which one?

Salah: //forty…

Oleg: //Forty-five…forty-five forty.

Salah: Okay. 

Oleg: Forty-five forty.

Will: There’s water, but not very much. 

Salah: //For me it’s good. 

Vika:...It doesn’t work for me. Can I go home?

00:07:59:28

Will: What isn’t working? …Wait here and just see if you can here…Just sit here. 

Oleg: Just sit for now. 

Will: //A little bit, while…maybe, it’ll get downloaded. 

Vika: I don’t object.

Oleg: Just doesn’t want to respond, yes?

00:08:27:01 – 00:08:43:05

[no audio]

Salah: Someone hacked my account. See the writing?

Ashley: What the freak?!

Vika: What?

Ashley: It’s like…he has chats here that are coming from the materials specialist, but he didn’t write them.

Will: Yeah sometimes it, like, its…it doesn’t load. You are actually reading somebody else…like another chat //that you are talking, but it’s just not displaying correctly. 

Ashley: //It’s so weird. 

00:09:16:14

Oleg: Sixteen sixteen. 

Ashley: Sixteen what?

Oleg: Sixteen sixteen. 

Will: No water. 

Ashley: Not even bother then. 

Salah: Oleg is looking for unique numbers. 

Oleg: Yes.

Will: Yeah, okay. 

Will: We’ve checked forty-three twenty. It wasn’t good, was it?

00:09:43:17

Oleg: Yes. Very dirty. …I, just, in this game I don’t understand why they gave the map if it was not connected to the relief. 

Vika: I didn’t understand. What the fuck is this?

Will: It is just a mistake. 

00:10:15:24

Salah: What happened, Vika?

Will: It’s doing the same thing it was doing for yours. It’s showing their own…

Ashley: What about ten forty-nine?

Vika: Nothing. I can’t. I can’t check. 

Oleg: Dirty. 

Ashley: You didn’t even look. 

Vika: Tell me what contamination we have there.

Ashley: Ten forty-nine. Please.

Oleg: Ten forty-nine?

Ashley: Yes.

Salah: Fucking deep. 

Will: No water. 

Ashley: Alright! Alright! Alright! You guys still…

Will: Alright. They said…

Vika: Ha-ha.

Will: Thirty-three forty-seven.

00:10:46:06

Oleg: Wow! What’s the matter? It’s so deep!

Will: Thirty-three forty-seven. 

Ashley: Thirty-three forty-seven, you said?

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay. Okay, okay.

Oleg: Shoot! Only…

Ashley: Oh! I like it very much. But…

Oleg: Which one?

Will: Thirty-three forty-seven. 

Ashley: Okay. Not very much.

Salah: It’s too deep but look for thirty-three forty-six. 

Will: One second. 

Salah: The one below. See, see, see, Ash.

00:11:17:06

Oleg: o!

Ashley: The one right below?

Salah: [SL] They said, //thirty-three forty-seven. 

Oleg: //Very deep. 

Vika: Oh! //Finally!

Ashley: //Uh-uh.

Salah: //Two thousand seven hundred. 

Ashley: Uh-uh, and you said, forty-six?

Salah: That one – seven hundred only. 

Vika: Okay. I am in for it. 

Ashley: I’m okay with that too. 

Will: No water.

Vika: Sixteen twenty-one – okay. 

Ashley: In which point? In his?

Will: In his. 

Ashley: What about theirs?

Will: It’s 96% water loss. I just told them that. 

00:11:51:00

Vika: What else do we need to check?

Salah: Look for nine thirty-seven. 

00:11:54:20 – 00:12:07:20

[no audio]

Vika: Mhm-m. High level of contamination. 

Salah:  Thirty-three thirty-three. 

Ashley: Thirty-three thirty-three.

00:12:41:25

Vika: No! 

Ashley: Twenty-seven forty-three. 

Oleg: It doesn’t work. 

Vika: Forty-three?

Ashley: Yes. 

Vika: Okay.

Ashley: Look at twenty-seven forty-three! 

00:13:08:24

Vika: High level of contamination. What do you think, Oleg?

Will: No water. 

Vika: Hm.

Ashley: Okay, okay.

Vika: Sorry. 

Oleg: It’s a nightmare! //Where did you find such water?

Salah: //Check eleven twenty-one.

Vika: Hm?

Oleg: //Not only do I…

Salah: //Eleven twenty-one. 

Ashley: Eleven twenty-one. 

00:13:32:17

Ashley: Not great, not great, not the best, not great. 

Vika: Not bad. 

Will: Not bad. It has water. It’s not great, but…

Ashley: Not my favorite.

Oleg: [UI]

00:13:45:28 – 00:14:21:16

[no audio]

Oleg: Minimum 30% of losses. 

Ashley: Thirty-one forty-one.

Vika: At least…why not, yes.

Oleg: Which one do you say? Thirty…

Ashley: Thirty-one forty-one. 

Will: There’s no water.

Oleg: I’m telling you there’s none. 

Will: Okay. Alright, we have to stop looking at points soon. We have to come up…we have a couple that have water already. We need to decide on those. 

00:14:51:17

Vika: Okay, which one?

Will: One second. 

Ashley: So, they are telling me that they are looking at thirty-one fifty and thirty-four forty-eight. 

Will: Thirty-one fifty. 

Ashley: Yes. So, they are now looking at thirty-one fifty – the first…well, at first. Oh, fucking survey. 

Vika: Thirty-one fifty, yes?

Ashley: Yes, thirty-one fifty. 

00:15:28:12

Salah: [SL] Why are they getting them and I’m not?

Ashley: I don’t know! 

Salah: Mhm. 

Vika: Not bad actually. 

Ashley: Oh! 

Salah: Which one?

Ashley: I said, thirty-one fifty. I can’t even check yet, because this…

Salah: Ashley can you see…I will write in the chat there after you finish. 

Ashley: And I’ll see if I get it?

Salah: Yeah. 

Ashley: Okay.
00:15:58:26

Ashley: Just one second. Sorry. 

Oleg: Thirty-seven and fifty, yes?

Ashley: Darn! …Questionnaires…

Salah: There is something. Because even there is no Signoff. 

Oleg: Why? Deep. 

Salah: I noticed. 

Oleg: There’s a not of water, yes?

Ashley: Oh, that’s weird. 

Salah: Hm. Do you receive anything?

Will: Well, //some water, but 96% losses. 

Ashley: //I can’t even check yet because of this thing. 

00:16:31:14

Oleg: Well, and it’s very deep. 

Will: Yes, yes, yes.

Oleg: Here it’s even…well, and it’s also dirty.

Ashley: Okay, so…Oh, god…dang it!

Oleg: What broke down again?

Ashley: Well, the questionnaires are bothering me. 

Oleg: Answer them.

Salah: Should I log out?

Ashley: Maybe. So, he //doesn’t even have the Signoff thing showing up on his…

Vika: //It’s okay, yes?

Salah: Because I don’t think it will finish the //task because I can’t sign.

Vika: //Drag your mission…where?

00:17:01:16

Ashley: Yeah. Maybe you should. 

Will: Yes, it is just a mistake. [SL] Seven…

Vika: [SL] Lock?

Will: Maybe, they can’t see that it is you. 

Vika: They can’t see me. 

Oleg: Oh, Salah, this is a good one for you – twenty-one eleven. 

Salah: Good?

Oleg: It’ll be great for you.

Ashley: Okay. Oh, //God dang it! 

Oleg: //Look at twenty-one eleven. 

Salah: Twenty-one?

Oleg: Eleven. 

Salah: Okay. 

Vika: Twenty-three forty-seven, what do we do? Signing – or not?

00:17:31:01

Ashley: So, they…okay, did everyone look at what they said? About thirty-one fifty? Or not yet?

Will: And what was the other one?

Ashley: The other one they said was thirty-four forty-eight. 

Vika: What about twenty-three forty-seven?

Ashley: One sec. I just want to verify the ones that they suggested. 

Will: A little bit better but still…

Ashley: So, thirty-one fifty is really good for me.

Salah: [SL] Did you check the chat?

Will: Thirty-one fifty has barely any water.

00:18:00:17

Ashley: Barely any water? Okay. And thirty-four forty-eight was…

Will: It’s not a lot of water but …it has a lot of water available, but it’s got 89% loss. So, it’s like borderline for me. 

Ashley: Okay. So, both of those are kind of borderline honestly. 

Will: Yeah.

Salah: Oh! Where is Igor and Reynold?

Vika: Sixteen seven.

Ashley: Sixteen seven. Okay.

00:18:36:02

Ashley: It’s absolutely bad for me. 

Salah: Mhm. Check in the chat. 

Ashley: Okay. Yeah, this is the human factors chat. 

Salah: [SL]They wrote already. On that last one.

Ashley: There is a three-minute delay, so, we can wait but …Yeah, these aren’t…these are not even…

Salah: Yeah.


00:19:00:09

Ashley: Like…this is all sorts of messed up. Drilling specialist is not in human factors, operations is not in human factors. These are not even numbers that we are discussing this week. 

Vika: Twenty-six ten.

Salah: Even the points. I didn’t choose these points. 

Ashley: Yeah. //This really weird.

Vika: //We haven’t chosen any point yet?

Will: Huh?

Salah: I log out //and log in, and it’s the same thing.

Will: //No. We said that…what do we have?

Ashley: Did you close the entire browser?

Salah: Yeah. //Let’s see.

Will: //What do we //have now?

Ashley: //Close it all. 

Will: The best…

Oleg: Sixteen twenty-one, perhaps. 

Will: Sixteen twenty-one is the best option. 

00:19:31:11

Ashley: Go to Desktop, yeah. 

Will: After that, we have forty-five…eleven forty-six. 

Vika: //I didn’t check.

Oleg: //And eleven forty-six, I think, it was dirty there. Hold on.

Will: Mm. Yes, yes, yes. It’s like eleven twenty-one – there’s forty-two thousand. But the best option is sixteen twenty-one.

Oleg: Yes. The very first one. Everything that I suggested after that – it is…

Vika: Yes, eleven forty-six – it’s a bit dirty. 

00:20:00:11

Ashley: Did you see what drilling said? “We are looking at a rectangle bounded by twenty-nine fifty and thirty-six forty-five”. Okay, they suggested one more here. Twenty-nine fifty…

Will: What are you doing? Well, okay. 

Ashley: Well, it’s a cool spot. Twenty-nine fifty. It’s super cool for me. Drilling specialist suggested it.

00:20:31:00

Will: Which one?

Ashley: Twenty-nine fifty. 

Oleg: But the depth is three thousand two hundred there. What will the losses be? 

Ashley: They also suggested thirty-six forty-five. 

Will: 100% water loss. 

Ashley: In the first one? 

Will: Yeah…twenty-nine…

Ashley: Mhm, okay. So…

Oleg: Salah will have great losses. Yes?

00:21:02:21

Vika: Thirty-six forty-five is okay for me. 

Ashley: Yes. It’s okay…

Will: And the other one?

Ashley: Thirty-six forty-five. 

Will: There’s little water. 

Oleg: [UI]

00:21:32:24

Oleg: Yes, thirty-six forty-five could work. 

Vika: Then, thirty-seven forty-three. …Thirty-seven forty-three. 

Will: Alright, let’s look at what they’ve given us. They sent thirty forty…thirty—four fifty…

00:22:05:29

Oleg: //And you thirty-seven forty-three is cool.

Salah: //Yeah, now it’s working. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Salah: So, let’s see.

Ashley: It might…it’ll…oh, there you go. Okay. 

Salah: Okay, it’s working.

Oleg: Has everyone looked at thirty-seven forty-three?

Ashley: Thirty-seven forty-three.

Vika: Salah, could you check please? 

00:22:30:15

Vika: Thirty-seven forty-three. 

Oleg: It should be good for Salah. 

Ashley: It’s good…

Salah: Which one?

Ashley: Thirty-seven forty-three.

Salah: Thirty-seven…

Ashley: It is good for me. 

Oleg: Well, that’s right, on the plain. How is it for you?

Salah: Yeah, it’s very good for me. 

Vika: Thirty-seven forty-three. 

Will: Mine is not responding.

Oleg: And, most importantly, whether there is water or not. We no longer have sources of confirmation. Can someone else tell us about the availability of water?

00:23:00:03

Vika: Maybe, we should check my…

Oleg: Is it showing you, too, how much water you have or don’t have?

Vika: Only indirectly. 

Oleg: How is it for you there?

Vika: You look at the depth.

Oleg: Well…

Vika: By the remoteness of the water basin.

Oleg: Oh, you have… Here, for example, the depth shows me, is there water or not, I can’t find out in any way. I can only talk about contamination and the depth of the deposits.

00:23:42:00

Salah: Will, what do you think about thirty-seven forty-three?

Vika: Did you fix it?

Salah: You said okay, huh?

Ashley: For which one? // Thirty-seven forty-three?

Salah: // Thirty-seven forty-three.

Ashley: I said, yeah. 

Salah: For me – okay. Vika – okay, Oleg – okay. //Only you, Will.

Vika: //Has it worked for you?

Will: Which one?

Salah: Thirty-seven forty-three.

Will: No water. 

00:24:29:13

Salah: Can you check thirty twenty-one?

Will: Okay, give me a minute.

Salah: Which point are they discussing?

Ashley: So, they had suggested thirty-six forty-five and thirty-one fifty. 

Vika: One more time.

Salah: Thirty-six

Ashley: Forty-five.

Salah: Okay. 

Vika: Again, which point?

Salah: This one is very good, Okay. The other one?

Ashley: Thirty-one fifty.

00:25:00:00

Salah: Thirty-one…fifty. No, this is too deep. 

00:25:10:25 – 00:25:43:06

[no audio]

Vika: Guys, could you check please, eighteen twenty-three?

Salah: We can’t.

Vika: Why?

Salah: We have a survey.

Vika: Oh, really?

Ashley: Yeah.

Vika: Why?

Oleg: You aren’t getting it?

Vika: No. Thanks, God!

Salah: Did you have it before?

Vika: Nope. 

Ashley: //Do you have…do you have…The same thing might have happened to you. Do you see “Signoff” on the top of yours?

Salah: //The same thing happened…

Will: Mhm. 

Salah: Signoff.

Ashley: No, does she see it?

Vika: No. 

Salah: //Log out. 

Ashley: //Yeah. The same thing happened. You’ve got to log out and log back in. 

Vika: Oh.

Salah: Yeah. It’s off. 

00:26:13:00

Vika: But still, could you check please?

Salah: Because she is looking for points with different numbers, by the way. 

Vika: Oh. 

Salah: Yeah. 

Vika: Are you sure?

Salah: Yeah. It happened to me. 

00:26:24:27 – 00:26:47:11

[no audio]

Will: And how did we…what do we think of eleven twenty-one?

Oleg: Eleven twenty-one?

Will: No, sorry…

Vika: Sixteen…

Will: Thirty-four forty-eight. What do we think?

Oleg: Hold on, hold on. 

Will: Thirty-four forty-eight. That was one of the ones they sent. How does that…

Oleg: Thirty-four forty-eight?

Will: Forty-eight. //What do you think of it?

Ashley: //Sorry, I still have the fucking survey. 

Salah: Thirty-seven forty-three. What did you say about it?

Will: I don’t know. Let me check. 

Salah: They said about it. 

Will: They suggested?

Salah: Yeah.

00:27:17:10

Will: Okay, let’s see here. 

Oleg: Very deep and…

Ashley: Oh, God almighty! 

Oleg: Minimum thirty percent. 

Will: No. No. There is no water at //thirty-seven forty-three.

Salah: //Thirty-seven forty-three?

Will: There is no water there. 

Salah: [UI] They suggested this point. 

Ashley: So, out of the ones that they suggested, I think thirty-six forty-five was a good one. Was it not?

00:27:51:12

Will: Thirty-six forty-five?

Salah: Yeah, thirty-six forty-five is good.

Will: No. I didn’t write that one down. I didn’t get that one. 

Ashley: Because I’m pretty sure all of us…I thought we all did check that one. 

Will: Thirty-six forty-five?

Salah: Thirty-six forty-five.

Will: I don’t see it in my stuff. Let me see here. 

Salah: Did you log out, Vika?

Vika: Yes. I’m busy with my questionnaire. 

Salah: Oh, okay.

Will: There is not a lot of water there. 

00:28:20:21

Salah: But it’s working?

Will: Let me see. 

Salah: Let’s go for it. 

Ashley: And then the other one that I thought we all, kind of, were okay with was thirty-one fifty. 

Vika: Okay. 

Salah: Too deep. 

Ashley: That one? Oh, that one you said was too deep. Okay, never mind. Scratch that. 

Vika: Which ones? Which point?

Ashley: So, the one…so, thirty-six forty-five, I think, is the one that we all said was, like, decently mediocre okay.

Vika: Forty-five?

Ashley: Yeah. 

Salah: Thirty-six forty-five. 

Vika: Alright.

00:28:50:06

Vika: It’s okay.

Will: Thirty-six forty-five. I mean, it’s not a lot of water but I mean, whatever. 

Salah: They suggested that? //That means they agreed about it. We have full team that agreed about this.

Ashley: //They suggested that one, yeah. 

Will: The best one that they’ve suggested, for me has been thirty-four forty-eight. 

Ashley: Thirty-four forty-eight. 

Will: That’s the best one they’ve suggested. 

Ashley: I mean, it’s decent for me too. 

00:29:19:20

Vika: No?

Ashley: It’s decent. Yeah, it’s normal. Could work. 

Salah: That’s normal also for me. 

Vika: One more time.

Will: Thirty-four forty-eight.

Vika: Okay. 

Salah: Thirty-four or…

Will: Thirty-four forty-eight.

Ashley: So, that one or the thirty-six forty-five is the ideal, right?

Will: Yeah. In terms of amount of water, thirty-four forty-eight is best. 

Vika: For me it’s okay.

00:29:54:29

Vika: Tiger, what do you think?

Salah: [SL] Now I’m checking. 

Vika: About this point. 

Salah: Thirty-four point…it’s too deep. 

Ashley: For which one? Thirty-four forty-eight?

Salah: Yeah. 

Vika: Mhm.

Ashley: Okay, so, thirty-six forty-five.

Vika: Sixteen seven. 

Will: Is this a new one?

Vika: Yep

00:30:26:24

Will: No water. 

Vika: Fuck. 

Ashley: Alright. Should we converge? 

 Will: Yeah, I told them…

Ashley: Was thirty-six forty-five good for you, too? No?

Vika: What?

00:30:57:11

Ashley: Thirty-six forty-five – no?

Oleg: Ah, thirty-six forty-five – yes. This one is good.

Ashley: It was okay, yes?

Oleg: Yes. It is…well, it’s the maximum, but it’s okay.

Ashley: Mhm.

Oleg: 10% loss. …Shoot, there was a great point somewhere. I can’t find it. 

00:31:21:21 – 00:32:10:28

[no audio]

Will: I told them that thirty-four forty-eight and thirty-six forty-five would do. These are not the best options, but we can do something about it.

Vika: Live a normal life?

Salah: You want?

Oleg: //Well, at least it’s better than what was suggested, I can’t find it for myself.

Ashley: //Yeah. [UI]

Vika: You will like it, Oleg, //twenty-one thirteen.  

Ashley: //Thank you. Oops. 

00:32:40:07

Oleg: Twenty-one thirteen? Hold on.

Vika: Really?

Ashley: Yeah. Actually, it is pretty good. 

Vika: //But it’s bad for Oleg. 

Oleg: //Fuck.

Salah: //Twenty-one?
Salah: Twenty-one zero three?

Oleg: It is, you know, if you’re spitting – you won’t spit it out, damn it!

Salah: You said, twenty-one zero three?

Oleg: In short, if you don’t want to get anything …It is just…//It’s not even water.

Ashley: //I wonder what twenty-one zero four is. 

00:33:16:23

Oleg: It’s just mud.

Salah: For me, I think, the best point until now is thirty-six forty-five. 

Ashley: I think so too.

Salah: Yeah. //Even the construction stability for me is a high number. 

Ashley: //Let’s just say that … Because we have little time left.

00:35:25:00

Oleg: Has anyone seen an algorithm or a pattern in the points tied to maps? There is more water on the slopes or at the foot...
