16019,Will, How’s that…,0,2101,statement,0
16020,Igor," Pay attention to the messages you receive from your group. And, in some cases, it is sometimes useful to voice them for the whole team here.",0,2101,statement,0
16021,Will," Yeah, so, I will see. I am now seeing that the people from the team of geologists – they said that they already have some points.",0,2101,statement,0
16022,Will," So, from the geologists…the geology team we already…they are saying that they already have some suggestions and coordinates. So, just FYI.

16059,Will, So.,0,2101,question,4
16060,Will," Ground type, water quality and filtration levels.",0,2101,statement,0
