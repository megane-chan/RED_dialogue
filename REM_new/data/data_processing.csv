12010,Oleg," the filtering system allows for filtering, but in this case it is too contaminated with small ones.",2106,statement

12019,Will, But it’s in the third place already. This is already far from the other ones that we have.,2106,statement
12020,Oleg," But if you look at the remaining forty percent, will that allow you to provide the population with water?",2106,question
12021,Will,"Well, yes. It looks like it will work with some water. There are so many... there are three thousand... There we lose... two-thirds. So there is a hundred thousand left.

You can see at any time where the messages are getting and how effectively those that you have already sent have been transmitted. The whole history of messages ... they can travel in circles, too. Theoretically, it may not reach the addressee. There may not be a logical chain to the addressee. You will see where it came from, who it passed through, and how it got to you.",2101,statement

Well, or more loaded with work. Or maybe they were just chosen, and therefore they have ... well, this should be taken into account when making decisions.

18932,Oleg, It will be at the limit.,2105,statement
18933,Ashley, Is it really deep for you?,2105,question
18934,Salah," Still, I didn’t check for it.",2105,statement
18935,Ashley, Seventeen thirty-nine. That might be the one that we converge on.,2105,statement
18936,Will," He said it was deep, but he said that it was okay.",2105,statement
18937,Ashley, Yep.,2105,backchannel
18938,Vika," There will be a massive water loss. Is there enough water, Will?",2105,question
18939,Will, What?,2105,question
18940,Oleg, Does seventeen thirty-nine possess a decent amount of water?,2105,question
18941,Will," Yes, yes, yes.",2105,statement
18942,Vika," Ah, it’s okay. The loss is within the norm. The loss is fine.",2105,statement
18943,Vika, //Yes. Okay. Seventeen thirty-nine.,2105,statement
18944,Ashley," //So, maybe we could…Sorry. One of my specialists says that at seventeen thirty-nine it is impossible to fully eliminate…",2105,floor-grabber
18945,Will, Huh?,2105,question
18946,Ashley, Eliminate. How do you say it?,2105,question
18947,Will, What...what…,2105,statement
18948,Ashley, There is no way to completely eliminate contamination with filters and materials at seventeen thirty-nine.,2105,statement
18949,Will, To filter contamination.,2105,statement
18950,Oleg, We have a method. We really do.,2105,statement
18951,Vika, He is unde....,2105,statement
18952,Oleg, The thing is...,2105,statement
18953,Will, Yeah.,2105,backchannel

18963,Oleg, The less the better.,2105,statement
18964,Ashley, Is it a drinking water if it's eighty-five or not?,2105,question
18965,Oleg, Drinking water is zero. It means it’s pure.,2105,statement
18966,Ashley," I see. Zero means drinking water. So, eighty-five is definitely not for drinking.",2105,statement
18967,Oleg," Well, of course. That's what it's filtered for.",2105,statement
18968,Ashley,"So if you clean it up to eighty-five, then there are 15% left to get drinking water.",2105,statement
18969,Oleg, No. There are filters that will allow you to do this to zero.,2105,statement
18970,Ashley, Mhm.,2105,backchannel
18971,Oleg,"But at the same time, losses will be up to 60%. Since the maximum value of the filters.",2105,statement
18972,Ashley,"So, at seventeen thirty-nine, you can only clean up to 85%.",2105,statement
18973,Oleg, Yes.,2105,statement
18974,Ashley, So it’s not the best point.,2105,statement

19007,Vika, Yeah. We can do that.,2105,statement
19008,Will, Other people in the geology team can handle it. We can handle it.,2105,statement
19009,Oleg, They are looking at us right now and like “Ahh! They eat!”,2105,statement
19010,Will," Like, “What the hell is wrong with that guy?”",2105,question
19011,Will," I’d love to see both teams on, like, a big screen with all six going.",2105,statement
19012,Ashley," Yeah. So, we can see where everyone’s looking; what are they thinking.",2105,statement
19013,Will, And sync the time.,2105,statement
19014,Ashley, That would be really cool.,2105,statement
19015,Vika, Hm…//nuts are here. You want?,2105,question

20550,Will, This is the time to actually do something cool.,2102,statement
20551,Oleg, The thing here is to give it to someone that can receive and process it as quickly as possible. But not to the person that sent it to you.,2102,statement
20552,Vika," Well, not necessarily. Maybe, you will send it back. Of course, you will exchange messages for a while, but then the one that sent it to you will send it on to somebody else.",2102,statement
20553,Oleg," But if that person sent it to you, it means that he or she looked and nothing…",2102,floor-grabber
20554,Will," But, maybe, that person did it quickly. Perhaps, they did not think about it.",2102,statement

8070,Vika," There will be a massive water loss. Is there enough water, Will?",12105,question
8071,Will, What?,12105,question
8072,Oleg, Does seventeen thirty-nine possess a decent amount of water?,12105,question
8073,Will," Yes, yes, yes.",12105,statement

8077,Will, Huh?,12105,question
8078,Ashley, Eliminate. How do you say it?,12105,question
8079,Will, What...what…,12105,statement
8080,Ashley, There is no way to completely eliminate contamination with filters and materials at seventeen thirty-nine.,12105,statement
8081,Will, To filter contamination.,12105,statement
8082,Oleg, We have a method. We really do.,12105,statement
8083,Vika, He is unde....,12105,statement
8084,Oleg, The thing is...,12105,statement

8095,Oleg, The less the better.,12105,statement
8096,Ashley, Is it a drinking water if it's eighty-five or not?,12105,question
8097,Oleg, Drinking water is zero. It means it’s pure.,12105,statement
8098,Ashley," I see. Zero means drinking water. So, eighty-five is definitely not for drinking.",12105,statement
8099,Oleg," Well, of course. That's what it's filtered for.",12105,statement
8100,Ashley,"So if you clean it up to eighty-five, then there are 15% left to get drinking water.",12105,statement
8101,Oleg, No. There are filters that will allow you to do this to zero.,12105,statement
8102,Ashley, Mhm.,12105,backchannel
8103,Oleg,"But at the same time, losses will be up to 60%. Since the maximum value of the filters.",12105,statement

8105,Oleg, Yes.,12105,statement
8106,Ashley, So it’s not the best point.,12105,statement
