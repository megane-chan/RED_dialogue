Katya,"Look, maybe somewhere in this area, but where you will lose less water.",2103,statement
Vika,Yes. I’m looking.,2103,statement
Katya,Something right next to it.,2103,statement

Will,Alright.,2104,statement
Will,Ten forty-seven. …It’s 100% and there is no water there.,2104,statement

Will,"Ten forty-seven, yeah.",2104,statement
Oleg,We were just considering it.,2104,statement

Oleg,"Forty-seven, yes?",2104,question
Katya,Mhm. Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven.,2104,statement
Oleg,"Oh, we looked at this one.",2104,statement
Katya,"//Doesn’t work, does it?",2104,question
Ashley,// Thirty-seven what?,2104,question
Katya,Thirty-seven and three.,2104,statement
Will,Why? Because it is okay for me. What did we have there? You can…,2104,question
Oleg,Mineral contamination is too great there.,2104,statement
Will,What percentage is it?,2104,question
Oleg,It will be…,2104,disruption
Katya,50%,2104,statement
Oleg,Yes. About 50%. No. I will have losses of about 45–50%.,2104,statement
Will,"Well, listen, let’s do the math. So…from another…//So, from this we have a hundred and thirty.",2104,statement
Ashley,//How much?,2104,question
Katya,//Thirty-seven…Thirty-seven and three.,2104,statement
Will,Times…//point sixty-five. How much do you lose?,2104,question
Ashley,"//Oh, we looked at it.",2104,statement
Oleg,45%,2104,statement
Will,So from there we can forty-six thousand... And from... what was it? Twelve forty-four?,2104,statement
Oleg,"So, twelve forty-four?",2104,question
Will,"Yes, we already looked there.",2104,statement
Oleg,Twelve forty-four – it was pretty dirty there.,2104,statement
Will,"Well, let’s look.",2104,statement
Oleg,"Hold on, hold on, hold on.",2104,statement
Will,Because there is a lot of water there.,2104,statement
Oleg,"So, twelve forty-four…",2104,floor-grabber
Katya,And the location is good.,2104,statement
Oleg,"Oh, it’s about 60% loss there.",2104,statement
Will,"Sixty, okay.",2104,statement
Oleg,The water is too murky. Small contaminants.,2104,statement
Will,"So…forty-three. Thus, the other one – forty-six. So, it’s a bit better than thirty-seven and three. It’s three thousand liters or gallons better there.",2104,statement
Ashley,"So, thirty-seven and three…",2104,statement
Will,At thirty-seven and three we can take forty-six thousand.,2104,statement
Ashley,"Okay. So, thirty-seven three has water, decent amount of water. It is a little bit contaminated.",2104,statement
Will,Yeah.,2104,backchannel
Ashley,But it’s still //workable. We can still work with that.,2104,statement
Will,//We can still…can take forty-nine normal ones there.,2104,statement
Ashley,"It’s a lot of water there, and while it’s slightly contaminated, it’s workable for us.",2104,statement
Vika,What is “disparate”?,2104,question
Ashley,“Disparate”?,2104,question
Will,"“Different, differences”",2104,floor-grabber
Ashley,"Like, “opposing” almost.",2104,statement
Vika,"Oh, okay. …[UI]",2104,statement
Ashley,it was…I guess that wasn’t …,2104,disruption
Katya,Isn’t it “Disparate housewives”?,2104,question
Ashley,"No. So, that’s “desperate”, and this is “disparate”.",2104,statement
Katya,"Too difficult, okay.",2104,statement
Ashley,"They are spelled a little differently too. …Well, I’m waiting to hear back from my team if thirty-seven three is okay, since we like it. Right?",2104,question

Oleg,Yes. It…,2104,statement
Will,"Yes, it seems. //So, it means, you…",2104,statement
Oleg,//Where do you see the effectiveness?,2104,question
Salah,What do they mean?,2104,question
Ashley,"//So, for example, I can’t see everything because I need the others from my team. So,",2104,statement
Will,"//It means that they want something but it’s probably, like, It’s like your last option. I mean, it’s…",2104,statement
Katya,Are they are spelt differently.,2104,statement
Ashley,//I simply don’t use it. I just look at mine.,2104,statement
Will,"//“Disparate” – it means “different things”. “Desperate” – it means that you want something, but it is, like, your last option.",2104,statement
Salah,//Desperate.,2104,statement

Oleg,//We’ve already looked at twenty-nine nineteen.,2104,statement

Vika,//Ah.,2104,statement

Ashley,We’ll see.,2104,statement
Katya,"How did you even find this point, Oleg?",2104,question

Vika,//Losses are the same as for the previous one.,2104,statement
Oleg,"So, the project is too expensive, yes?",2104,question
Ashley,Make sure…,2104,floor-grabber
Will,"It seems a little low. Three forty-nine is good for me, but for the structural geologist it would be too low. So, they will still need to respond about twenty-nine nineteen, and we will know.",2104,statement
Oleg,"Mhm. Yes, twenty-nine. Yes, in principle, it’s acceptable.",2104,statement
Oleg,"The biggest thing for me is that we don’t combine filters…One component only. Salah, what are your suggestions? Where do you like it?",2104,question
Salah,[SL] Yes.,2104,statement
Will,Okay. They say twenty-nine nineteen might work for them too.,2104,statement

Will,"What do you mean? So, it is…",2116,question
Oleg,"Well, for me, for example, if it is deep, it may be clean. Surface water is dirtier. So, I can indirectly determine things by the water depth.",2116,statement
Will,"I have, specifically… specifically, the main formula is the average water loss. It depends on…",2116,statement
Oleg,On the depth?,2116,question
Will,"No. It depends on…there are two layers and there are two types of what the layers consist of. That is what determines the percentage of water loss. That’s all. But it doesn’t really affect it because either it’s already in the calculation, so I don’t have to do anything with it, but just say what percentage of water is lost and how much water there is there...",2116,statement
Ashley,Let’s write here.,2116,statement

Ashley,It reaches high population.,2115,statement
Will,"95% water loss. I can see now. There is a connection here. So, there is supposed to be a lot of water there. So, there is like two hundred and forty-five K liters, right? But the thing is that it’s got the water loss. Which means that it’s not sustainable in a long run. As far as I understand it. So…",2115,statement
Oleg,The water loss is very high unfortunately.,2115,statement
Vika,"Well, it’s the same as the last one.",2115,statement

Vika,//Twenty-two twenty-seven.,2115,statement
Will,"Forty-one percent, but it’s…it’s…",2115,floor-grabber
Ashley,I like it about as much as his. Which is “eh”.,2115,statement
Oleg,"Vika, the losses will be high.",2115,statement
Salah,It’s normal. Even the depth. It’s not the best one.,2115,statement
Ashley,Yeah.,2115,backchannel
Oleg,"It is possible to clean it, but…",2115,disruption
Ashley,What about…,2115,floor-grabber
Vika,No.,2115,statement
Ashley,What about twenty-five five?,2115,question
Will,"Okay, I have to check. Vika, which was the one that you wanted?",2115,question
Vika,Twenty-two twenty-seven.,2115,statement

Vika,Ew!,2115,statement
Will,Let’s get to the point. What is this about?,2115,question
Ashley,It’s about access…Location accessibility. As well as how much population can be supported by the amount that is there. And the number is //quite low for the population reached.,2115,statement

Oleg,"How about twenty-one sixteen? I just randomly picked it. It’s not great for me, but is there any pattern?",2115,question
Vika,Absolutely not. The water is very dirty. And the losses are high because of high UCA.,2115,statement
Will,Which number?,2115,question

Oleg,"We need to find a map of water, where there is some to begin with. And then evaluate its quality.",2107,statement
Oleg,"Forty fifty, fifty fifty.",2107,statement
Salah,"They are saying, forty-one eleven works for them.",2107,statement
Will,Yeah.,2107,backchannel
Salah,“Twenty-one twenty really does not work for our maintenance specialist.”,2107,statement
Vika,"Yeah, okay, but…",2107,floor-grabber
Salah,But it’s not working for us also.,2107,statement
Will,//Twenty-one twenty?,2107,question
Vika,//But twenty-nine…,2107,floor-grabber
Salah,No. Forty-one eleven.,2107,statement
Will,"Yeah. We let them know. We just have to wait until they hear it. I mean, they probably haven’t even gotten our messages yet.",2107,statement
Salah,Hm.,2107,backchannel
Vika,And twenty-nine thirty-two.,2107,statement
Will,Mhm.,2107,backchannel
Salah,Twenty-nine thirty…,2107,floor-grabber
Vika,Yeah.,2107,backchannel
Will,Yeah.,2107,backchannel
Salah,Yeah. This is good for us.,2107,statement
Vika,Okay. Perfect.,2107,statement
Will,[SL] Yeah. I told them.,2107,statement
Vika,"So, Oleg. Thirty-five fifty – high water loss.",2107,statement
Oleg,Thirty fifty.,2107,statement
Vika,We had thirty-five fifty.,2107,statement
Oleg,No.,2107,statement
Vika,No? Thirty fifty? Let me look.,2107,statement
Oleg,And then…,2107,question
Vika,Same.,2107,statement
Oleg,And there’s also fifty-fifty on this line. It’s just wonderful. Pure water. [UI] don’t want.,2107,statement
Ashley,"And, sorry, the forty-one eleven was too deep, no water",2107,statement
Salah,Yeah.,2107,backchannel
Ashley,"And couldn’t be…too contaminated, I guess.",2107,statement
Salah,Yeah.,2107,backchannel
Ashley,Is that what it was.,2107,statement
Will,There is no water.,2107,statement
Will,Eighteen thirty.,2107,statement
Salah,"Just tell //them there is no water because even if it’s not deep, there is no point, you know?",2107,question
Will,//Eighteen thirty.,2107,statement
Oleg,Mhm-m.,2107,backchannel
Vika,"I like it. There are soluble for me… High… high contamination, //but",2107,disruption
Salah,It’s too deep.,2107,statement
Vika,"soluble in the first. If you can filter it, then I agree.",2107,statement
Oleg,"Darn. Here, one stage would not be enough.",2107,statement
Vika,Hello. Do you want this now?,2107,question
Will,"So, for you – yes. Eighteen thirty?",2107,question
Vika,I don’t agree until our bioengineer says. //If Oleg filters...,2107,statement
Will,"//I’m not asking. You know, like, does it work or doesn’t it work. I was just asking for the amount.",2107,statement
Vika,Fifty fifty.,2107,statement
Oleg,"It will be very difficult for me to clean it, because...",2107,statement
Will,"So, then no, right? Okay.",2107,question
Vika,"No, it means, no.",2107,statement
Will,And this one for you? For yours?,2107,question
Vika,"Not for me either, then. Because he will not be able to filter, and there is high contamination.",2107,statement
Will,"I’m not asking about him. He has already given me his opinion. So, about yours.",2107,statement
Vika,"No. No, no.",2107,statement
Will,No? Okay. Eighteen thirty?,2107,question
Oleg,"Although, for this one, maybe you can try. 60–70% of the loss will be just during filtration.",2107,statement
Will,"Well, there’s a lot of water there. I’m just collecting this. I always have a list",2107,statement
Oleg,where possible.,2107,statement
Will,"points where there is something. Type, pros, cons. So I need to know //to whom [UI]",2107,statement
Oleg,"//Well, in short, here it is – only 40% will remain.",2107,statement
Vika,"//Salah, thirty-eight twenty-two.",2107,statement
Will,"Let’s, okay.",2107,statement
Salah,Thirty-eight,2107,floor-grabber

Vika,//Yeah.,2107,statement
Oleg,Yes.,2107,statement
Will,In your spot. Eighteen thirty?,2107,question
Salah,It’s deep.,2107,statement
Will,Okay.,2107,statement
Salah,The eighteen thirty is normal.,2107,statement
Will,"Okay, good. Then that’s a plus. Okay.",2107,statement

Oleg,"So, this and there’s one more here…Yes. 40% loss. Okay.",2107,statement
Will,"They said: “Yes, twenty-nine thirty-two – it’s bad”.",2107,statement
Ashley,Is there any water at sixteen nineteen?,2107,question
Vika,Sixteen,2107,floor-grabber
Ashley,Sixteen nineteen. Is there something good for you there?,2107,question
Will,No.,2107,statement
Vika,You didn’t even give a chance. There are great losses there.,2107,statement

Will,"Oleg, what are you…",2107,floor-grabber
Salah,//Thirty-eight twenty-two.,2107,statement

Vika,Forty-three?,2107,question
Will,Forty zero three.,2107,statement
Vika,"It’s high contamination there...If you can filter it, it may work.",2107,statement
Ashley,"//So, you’ll lose it, like, during the drilling process?",2107,question
Will,"There is some…it’s just, like, over…//it’s not during the drilling process it’s just that the…loss between…there is, like, two different types of reservoirs, and when they sit up next to each other in a weird way, what ends up happening is that over time the water basically flows from one to the other. So, you’re drilling into one, but it loses it. So, you can’t…",2107,statement
Ashley,//Asking him.,2107,statement
Ashley,Okay.,2107,statement
Will,You won’t actually have access to that water.,2107,statement

Will,"Wait, what?",2107,question
Salah,Yeah. Even for us.,2107,statement
Ashley,"Wait, wait, wait. Never mind. No, no! Fuck! I keep messing up! I keep forgetting that’s you. Hang on.",2107,statement

Ashley,"The best points are twenty-nine thirty-three, twenty-one…",2107,floor-grabber
Will,Twenty-nine thirty-three?,2107,question
Ashley,Yeah.,2107,statement
Salah,Thirty-three? Not thirty-two?,2107,question

Salah,Yeah.,2107,backchannel
Will,"Twenty-nine thirty-three? //Oh, yeah.",2107,statement
Vika,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",2107,statement

Vika,And it was good.,2107,statement
Oleg,Then //twenty-one twenty.,2107,statement
Ashley,//And then twenty-one twenty.,2107,statement
Salah,It was deep.,2107,statement
Vika,"Oh, deep for you. Okay.",2107,statement
Oleg,Forty-one…,2107,floor-grabber

Will,What was it? Forty…,2107,question
Ashley,Forty-four twenty.,2107,statement
Will,Forty-four…An error occurred.,2107,statement
Ashley,Oh.,2107,statement
Will,Oh.,2107,statement
Vika,"It’s //not bad, but in case Oleg could clean it.",2107,statement
Ashley,//I just got that too.,2107,statement
Oleg,I’ll check now.,2107,statement
Will,Loses almost all of its water.,2107,statement
Ashley,Okay.,2107,statement
Will,"//So, forty-four twenty.",2107,statement
Oleg,"//Again, it goes beyond…",2107,floor-grabber
Ashley,Another option they’re suggesting right now is eleven thirty.,2107,statement
Ashley,Eleven thirty is another option they suggested here.,2107,statement
Oleg,"Dirty…Well, we are again beyond 60%.",2107,statement
Vika,"Yes, it’s very high.",2107,statement
Ashley,"Oh, I like eleven thirty. I like eleven thirty very much.",2107,statement
Will,Eleven thirty…Fingers crossed. Not…,2107,statement
Will,It’s not a lot of water but it’s workable.,2107,statement
Ashley,Okay. Okay. What about you?,2107,question
Salah,Water depth – one point seven.,2107,statement
Ashley,It’s not the worst. Could be worse.,2107,statement
Salah,"For you, huh?",2107,question
Vika,It’s not the best point.,2107,statement
Ashley,Fair enough. Okay.,2107,statement
Will,"Yeah, it’s the lowest end of…",2107,floor-grabber
Ashley,"So, if we were to rank…",2107,floor-grabber
Salah,Twenty-nine thirty-two is the first one,2107,floor-grabber
Ashley,Okay.,2107,statement
Salah,Twenty-one twenty is the second,2107,floor-grabber
Vika,Twenty-nine thirty-three was the first one.,2107,statement
Salah,Thirty-two.,2107,statement
Ashley,"Well, so, they are suggesting thirty-three now. I mean, as the point that they like. Our first point, yeah. Like Vika mentioned, so I don’t know.",2107,statement
Will,Okay.,2107,statement
Salah,Did you get a…because I’m asking about twenty-nine thirty-two. I didn’t get any reply. Did you?,2107,question
Ashley,"Oh, I’m talking with the engineering team.",2107,statement
Will,"Twenty-nine thirty-two, yes. That’s a No from the operations specialist.",2107,statement
Ashley,But thirty-three was okay?,2107,question
Will,thirty-two.,2107,statement
Ashley,Okay.,2107,statement
Will,Thirty-three – I think they suggested that.,2107,statement

Will,That one is good for me. But…,2107,statement
Ashley,Was it better or worse than twenty-one twenty?,2107,question
Will,We hit three out of five on that one.,2107,statement
Salah,Mhm.,2107,backchannel
Ashley,And twenty-one twenty hit most of us. Didn’t it?,2107,question
Salah,And twenty-nine thirty-two.,2107,statement
Will,Twenty-one twenty had all of us.,2107,statement
Salah,And twenty-nine thirty-two.,2107,statement
Ashley,"I thought, he just said that thirty-two was exinated.",2107,statement

Will,Eleven thirty – it…,2107,floor-grabber
Vika,"It’s deep. Salah said, it’s deep.",2107,statement

Will,"but, like, I don’t know…how much water…",2107,disruption
Oleg,Too little?,2107,question
Will,"Little. So, like…",2107,statement
Ashley,Could it be a third-place runner?,2107,question
Will,//[UI] runner.,2107,statement
Oleg,"//For me, it provides clean water. Good water.",2107,statement
Ashley,Fair enough.,2107,statement

Salah,"Yeah, we suggested, but…",2117,floor-grabber
Will,"Yeah, well, let them work. You know, remember there’s a big gap here in time, so, they probably discussed that. That means that they sent that four minutes ago, so…",2117,statement
Salah,[SL] Ok so let’s check this one.,2117,statement
Oleg,"So from what we have, the best thing was what they offered or what we had?",2117,question
Will,Where there is plenty of water it's ours.,2117,statement
Will,But what is better for everyone — it’s theirs offer.,2117,statement
Oleg,Twenty-two thirty-seven?,2117,question

Salah,This is robotics.,2117,statement
Ashley,"Oh, because I said, like, “I hope that you got our videos.” And they said, “We did.” So, they got our videos. Also, I just realized that that’s you…That’s why I was like, “Oh my God!”. That’s what I’m saying.",2117,statement
Salah,I make you happy.,2117,statement

Vika,Forty forty-five is very dirty. The previous one was better.,2117,statement
Ole,//Well that wouldn’t do definitely.,2117,statement
Ashley,//It is very...definitely no. Too dirty and…,2117,statement
Salah,//Which one are they talking about?,2117,question
Oleg,There will be a very big loss.,2117,statement
Will,I don’t know.,2117,statement
Oleg,"I will clean it up, but the loss will be up to 60%. Only while cleaning. And look how much water is there.",2117,statement
Ashley,"But we do like nine twenty-eight, right?",2117,question
Will,"Yeah, yeah.",2117,statement
Ashley,They are asking me if I like that.,2117,statement
Will,Yeah.,2117,backchannel

Will,"Nine twenty-eight, but we're just waiting for them.",2117,statement
Ashley,Six…,2117,floor-grabber
Maybe Salah,"[SL] Twenty-eight. [UI] …Third one: “We need video from you, guys?”",2117,question
Ashley,They already gave us a video.,2117,statement
Salah,When?,2117,question
Ashley,They gave us the group video. That’s why we sent one in response.,2117,statement
Salah,We sent?,2117,question
Ashley,They sent to us before we sent our video.,2117,statement
Will,And then they sent one in response.,2117,statement
Ashley,They sent another one?,2117,question
Will,"Oh, no.",2117,statement
Salah,"No, I’m asking about the response.",2117,statement
Will,We sent a video; they sent a video. We sent another video. They need to send another one now.,2117,statement

Will,"You don’t just write to somebody: “Hello! – Hi, how are you?!” //And then you…you don’t end the conversation at that point.",2117,question
Ashley,//But we didn’t ask them. We didn’t ask them any additional questions.,2117,statement
Salah,We miss them. That’s why we want the video.,2117,statement
Ashley,"Alright, alright.",2117,statement
Will,This might be the last time we talk to this group.,2117,statement
Oleg,Have you written to everybody?,2117,question

Vika,No.,2117,statement
Will,Thank you.,2117,statement
Vika,No.,2117,statement
Will,Well actually no.,2117,statement
Vika,The structural geologist appears to be Armenian.,2117,statement
Will,Really?,2117,question
Oleg,Why?,2117,question
Vika,Because he writes in Russian and is in Armenia.,2117,statement
Will,"And he says that he was born in Armenia. And he showed us his Instagram, although we told him that we //can't see it, but...",2117,statement
Vika,"//We don't have access, yes.",2117,statement
Ashley,Wait! You guys have Instagram and stuff?,2117,question
Salah,What?,2117,question
Will,What do you mean?,2117,question
Vika,What?! What?! What?!,2117,question
Will,What are you talking about?,2117,question
Ashley,What did you say?,2117,question
Will,"He said…he said…he told us his Instagram, but then we said that we don’t have access to Instagram, but…but his name is W. Ogonyan or something like that, so he was like, “Okay, alright.”",2117,statement
Vika,"//Yes, right.",2117,statement
Will,He is Armenian like literally.,2117,statement

Vika,//He is now in Armenia.,2117,statement
Will,"I mean, we can’t connect with them.",2117,statement
Ashley,After isolation we can.,2117,statement
Will,We literally are not capable of connecting with them. We can’t do anything on our Instagram. We can’t…,2117,statement
Ashley,What do you mean? After isolation we can.,2117,statement
Will,"I know that, but I’m saying that we are in isolation, and we can’t do it because we don’t have social media.",2117,statement
Ashley,He’s probably giving it to you so you can do it later!,2117,statement
Will,"Yeah, that’s exactly why, but it doesn’t…",2117,floor-grabber
Ashley,I know that we don’t have access right now…I mean…This is the last time we are with this group. That’s why everybody is giving it to you.,2117,statement
Will,I know. That was the whole point of what I said.,2117,statement
Ashley,Oh.,2117,statement
Vika,Oh damn it! …Okay.,2117,statement
Salah,What did they say?,2117,question

Oleg,"Will, how does your temperature affect your metrics? Or you do not appreciate it at all?",2117,question
Will,You don’t have to do it that’s my job.,2117,statement
Ashley,"Wait, what just happened? Why did everything just go blank in the sign-off?",2117,question
Will,Mine isn’t blank.,2117,statement
Ashley,"Mine is completely blank now, and it was just filled in. By everyone. Basically.",2117,statement
Oleg,"Will, do you work only with two indicators: material of LHSB and [UI]?",2117,question
Will:,"I even... for the most part, I don't even look at them. It is for the structural geologist.",2117,statement
Oleg,And what is the parameter? What is it called?,2117,question
Will,It is called «average water loss».,2117,statement
Oleg,Yep.,2117,backchannel
Vika,Hello there. Important.,2117,statement

Ashley,Did you delete something in the name?,2117,question
Salah,"No, nothing.",2117,statement

Ashley,"Come on, Chicago! …Where you at?",2106,question
Vika,Do you remember that last time we had the same situation?,2106,question
Ashley,"Whereas, like, they were delayed?",2106,question
Vika,Yeah.,2106,statement
Will,"I mean, I think they log on and then it’s a…",2106,disruption
Oleg,"Ash…at least now the points are here, but still nothing is working.",2106,statement
Will,"Sometimes, it’s just…",2106,floor-grabber
Ashley,"Maybe, simply…//If we have the time, you can fully reboot the computer.",2106,statement
Will,//It takes a long time to load.,2106,statement
Will,No. It’s just…,2106,statement
Oleg,Server?,2106,question
Will,It’ll take the same amount of time.,2106,statement
Oleg,"Well, I will wait for now //five minutes.",2106,statement
Ashley,//Or turn off HRP and turn it on again?,2106,question
Will,That’s not the point.,2106,statement
Oleg,"Well, then we’ll wait.",2106,statement
Vika,Chicago.,2106,statement
Ashley,"Because they are not even in the same place. It’s not the same, they are in different places.",2106,statement
Oleg,They are still sleeping.,2106,statement
Ashley,Six hours. [SL] I also think [UI],2106,statement
Oleg,"On the twenty-eighth, when it’s before…it’s already past Christmas, the New Year’s.",2106,statement
Vika,Hm.,2106,backchannel
Ashley,"That’s right. Yeah, that’s right! They //are all on a holiday break now.",2106,statement
Salah,"//Will, check twenty-two…twenty-two nine.",2106,statement
Will,Twenty-two nine?,2106,question
Salah,Twenty-two nine.,2106,statement
Ashley,Twenty-two nine?,2106,question
Will,No water.,2106,statement
Ashley,"You know, I should really wait to put the mark down before I hear…until I hear Will say something.",2106,statement
Vika,Right.,2106,backchannel
Ashley,Darn it!,2106,statement
Oleg,I’ll try again.,2106,statement
Will,Cool.,2106,statement
Ashley,There.,2106,statement
Vika,Thank you so very much. You don’t have to send it off today.,2106,statement
Ashley,I wish you could delete the red dots from your map.,2106,statement
Salah,Mhm.,2106,backchannel
Oleg,Oh.,2106,backchannel
Vika,What’s the matter?,2106,question
Oleg,It’s working…Eureka! It’s an amazing spot!,2106,statement
Vika,Which one?,2106,question
Oleg,Seven eleven.,2106,statement
Vika,And what about ten thirty?,2106,question
Oleg,Ten thirty? Hold on.,2106,statement
Oleg,"Okay, ten thirty. No. Well…",2106,statement
Vika,Why?,2106,question
Oleg,"Well, in principle, it might do. I don’t object.",2106,statement
Will,"Seven eleven looks like our best one, yes?",2106,question
Oleg,Yes. Seven eleven is just great.,2106,statement
Ashley,"Nice job, Vika!",2106,statement
Vika,Hm?,2106,question
Ashley,Nice job finding it.,2106,statement
Oleg,Does seven eleven work for you too?,2106,question
Will,Yes.,2106,statement
Oleg,"Well, then we accept it and that’s it. Everything is done.",2106,statement
Vika,And we will go ahead and do our own things. We’ll just inform Chicago of the fact.,2106,statement
Salah,Which point now we agreed?,2106,question
Vika,Seven eleven.,2106,statement
Salah,What about ten thirty?,2106,question
Ashley,"We also think that’s fine, but //seven eleven is better.",2106,statement
Will,It’s about half as good in terms of water.,2106,statement
Vika,Oh…It’s you again.,2106,statement
Will,You again.,2106,statement
Vika,You are living a verified life…Darn…,2106,floor-grabber
Oleg,If we think about and consider it //there’s little sense in this there?,2106,question
Ashley,//What if there is some?,2106,question
Oleg,"It’s better…well, in your opinion, where is a better place for it? On a slope or on a plain?",2106,question
Oleg,I think it’s the plain.,2106,statement
Ashley,On the plain.,2106,statement
Oleg,Yes.,2106,statement
Ashley,Definitely.,2106,statement
Oleg,"If it’s on the plain, then this can lead to the deposits being too deep. That’s where the crater is, there’s bare ground. Will, do you have a preference if there’s a plain somewhere... There’s right here... in the upper right corner.",2106,statement
Will,"It’s random for me for some reason. First it works for me, then it doesn’t work.",2106,statement
Will,It doesn’t affect the…,2106,disruption
Oleg,"So, we need to do some research here. We need to look…",2106,floor-grabber
Will,This…This…I didn’t notice any…this…,2106,disruption
Oleg,"What is your parameter? Maybe, I have it shown too.",2106,statement
Will,"For me, it’s the average water loss и amount of water available, but I think it’s only for me.",2106,statement
Oleg,Mhm.,2106,backchannel
Ashley,And what do you think about twenty-eight four?,2106,question
Will,Let me check it.,2106,statement
Will,Which one? Twenty-eight…,2106,question
Ashley,Mhm. Four.,2106,statement
Will,Twenty-eight four.,2106,statement
Oleg,"Oh, wow. Who is walking around there?",2106,question
Ashley,Seriously? Very often.,2106,statement
Vika,Very dirty water.,2106,statement
Oleg,"Oh, yes. Very dirty.",2106,statement
Ashley,No? Okay.,2106,question
Oleg,"So, it’s not the best option, not even by a long shot.",2106,statement
Ashley,And what about water?,2106,question
Will,Too little.,2106,statement
Ashley,Okay.,2106,statement
Will,But now…,2106,floor-grabber
Ashley,No problem.,2106,statement
Will,Twenty twenty-four.,2106,statement
Salah,Depth is okay for me.,2106,statement
Ashley,Thanks…One. One person likes…the spot.,2106,statement
Salah,"//Actually, this point – seven eleven…See the depth?",2106,question
Will,//Fifty-four forty-six.,2106,statement
Ashley,Is that quite deep or compared to…,2106,disruption
Salah,"Yeah, it’s deep.",2106,statement
Ashley,What’s the other one?,2106,question
Salah,This is seven eleven.,2106,statement
Ashley,Uh-uh. What’s…,2106,disruption
Salah,The other one – thirty.,2106,statement
Ashley,What about down here?,2106,question
Salah,"So, you see the one you choose.",2106,statement
Ashley,Hm. Oh!,2106,statement
Salah,That’s what’s my concern. I’m actually looking at the depth.,2106,statement
Oleg,"Oh, here’s an option that’s not bad - //forty fifty.",2106,statement
Salah,//Usually I’m checking if it’s about a thousand.,2106,statement
Oleg,Look at forty fifty.,2106,statement
Ashley,Forty fifty.,2106,statement
Will,Which one did you say? Forty…,2106,question
Vika,Fifty.,2106,statement
Oleg,Forty fifty.,2106,statement
Ashley,"Oh-oh-oh. There, like…",2106,floor-grabber
Vika,High water loss.,2106,statement
Vika,Almost 100%.,2106,statement
Will,There’s no water there in the end.,2106,statement
Oleg,"And the fact that it’s deep doesn’t matter, does it?",2106,question
Will,"Deep for what, if there’s no water there?",2106,question
Ashley,Where?,2106,question
Oleg,"I think we should start with where there is water. Otherwise, what is the point of us evaluating?",2106,question
Will,"Yes. It is, just…I am looking so if…",2106,disruption
Oleg,"Here’s forty forty. It’s these spots. Here, if we look specifically for a plain that would work for everyone…",2106,statement
Will,Let’s look at fourteen six. Fourteen six.,2106,statement
Salah,Fourteen?,2106,question
Will,Six.,2106,statement
Ashley,"I mean, it’s less desirable for me but…",2106,disruption
Vika,//What do you say in terms of contamination?,2106,question
Salah,//Impossible for me.,2106,statement
Ashley,Impossible?,2106,question
Vika,It’s very high.,2106,statement
Ashley,Wow! That’s really deep.,2106,statement
Oleg,"Well, thirty. You can put filters, but much better than we received last time. Not great, but the issue can be resolved.",2106,statement
Oleg,"So, it’s thirty by thirty. Simply, [UI].",2106,statement
Ashley,"Oh, I see. Fluid engineer says…Okay, they are starting now.",2106,statement
Oleg,Oh.,2106,statement
Ashley,I mean…,2106,disruption
Vika,"Yeah, it’s okay.",2106,statement
Salah,Which one?,2106,question
Vika,Fourteen six.,2106,statement
Oleg,"Okay, we are all…",2106,floor-grabber
Vika,What?,2106,question
Will,Fourteen six? It’s okay for you?,2106,question
Vika,Yeah.,2106,statement
Ashley,"It’s not good, it’s not…",2106,disruption
Vika,"For me, contamination is //high.",2106,statement

Vika,No?,2106,question
Salah,It’s too deep. Two thousand!,2106,statement
Vika,Fourteen six?,2106,question
Ashley,"Yeah. //It’s not great for me either, honestly.",2106,statement
Salah,//Two thousand two hundred fifty.,2106,statement
Vika,"Oh, okay.",2106,statement
Oleg,They are waiting…,2106,floor-grabber
Ashley,Sorry.,2106,statement
Oleg,They just responded to me. They are saying the geologists are looking where,2106,floor-grabber
Oleg,"there are deposits of water. After that, they will make a decision... so right now, I think Will’s most important mission is to find where there is water at all. After that, evaluate how much we will lose ... during the development.",2106,statement
Salah,"They are so slow, you know?",2106,question
Will,"I mean, there is like four-minute…",2106,disruption
Ashley,Three.,2106,statement
Will,Is it three?,2106,question
Ashley,"Three-minute each way, yeah.",2106,statement
Will,Three-minute there and three-minute back.,2106,statement
Salah,"//So, it’s six minutes. Not sixty.",2106,statement
Ashley,//Six minutes total.,2106,statement
Will,"Yeah, but they didn’t log on until just now.",2106,statement
Ashley,Yeah. Apparently they were waiting for their structural geologist.,2106,statement
Ashley,Alright.,2106,statement
Oleg,"[UI]… Okay, the meteorologist is making some noise here…Is that you?",2106,question
Ashley,"I am a meteorologist, yes.",2106,statement
Oleg,"Yes, me. Hello to Moscow. And why did you write to me?",2106,question
Ashley,I wrote to all the teams.,2106,statement
Oleg,I see.,2106,statement
Ashley,I want to be connected to everyone.,2106,statement
Oleg,"I see, I see.",2106,statement
Oleg,"Well, they responded with the same thing to you…I think they respond to everyone with the same thing.",2106,statement
Ashley,I am also copy-pasting this. Pasting?,2106,question
Oleg,Such a disgrace.,2106,statement
Oleg,"In short, there’s no water. There is no water on Mars.",2106,statement
Will,Hm…mm…,2106,backchannel
Vika,"[SL] Now what, we are not going?",2106,question
Oleg,Turn around. …In this crater under the name…or under the title…,2106,statement
Vika,Only you are interested in that.,2106,statement
Vika,Has someone else found something? Or is nobody looking and just waiting? …Yes.,2106,statement
Oleg,"You know, how was it in TTB? “There’s no goal” – all rise.",2106,question
Oleg,"When the geologist was upset, like…",2106,question
Vika,"Oh, really? Are we all feeling like sleeping already?",2106,question
Oleg,Yes.,2106,statement
Vika,Sorry.,2106,statement
Ashley,Hm.,2106,backchannel
Will,Bla-la-la-la.,2106,statement
Salah,"So, we all agreed on points seven eleven and ten thirty?",2106,question
Will,We are still looking.,2106,statement
Salah,Check thirty-five twenty-two.,2106,statement
Ashley,Thirty-five thirty-two?,2106,question
Salah,Twenty-two.,2106,statement
Ashley,Twenty-two.,2106,statement
Will,100% water loss.,2106,statement
Oleg,Forty-five twenty-two?,2106,question
Vika,You don’t need to look.,2106,statement
Oleg,"What, not at all?",2106,question
Ashley,"Weather is not so great there. Could reach a high population, but //a lot of safety zones.",2106,statement
Vika,Can you repeat place? Which point?,2106,question
Ashley,"He said, thirty-five twenty-two.",2106,statement
Vika,Thirty-five twenty-two.,2106,statement
Ashley,"Yes. Our meteorology costs are going to be quite high there due to all the yellow, orange and red zones we have.",2106,statement
Salah,"It’s [UI], you think?",2106,question
Oleg,It’s not even shown for me.,2106,statement
Vika,There’s very little water there.,2106,statement
Ashley,Okay. We are scrapping. It won’t work.,2106,statement
Oleg,"Who came up with it? For me, it’s outside the boundaries of the territory.",2106,question
Ashley,//Salik.,2106,statement
Vika,//Outside the boundaries?,2106,question
Oleg,"Well, forty-five I can’t even see.",2106,statement
Will,Mhm-hm.,2106,statement
Ashley,No. It should be thirty-five.,2106,statement
Will,Let’s try nineteen twenty-nine.,2106,statement
Ashley,Nineteen…,2106,floor-grabber
Will,Nineteen twenty-nine.,2106,statement
Ashley,Twenty-nine.,2106,statement
Ashley,"Well, it’s not too bad.",2106,statement
Oleg,"We’ve already been there. Oh, everything is murky again…",2106,floor-grabber
Vika,High contamination.,2106,statement
Oleg,Murky particles.,2106,statement
Salah,Very good for me.,2106,statement
Ashley,"Yeah. It’s not bad, really.",2106,statement
Salah,Go ahead.,2106,statement
Oleg,I can’t even filter it.,2106,statement
Will,"//What do you mean, you can’t?",2106,question
Ashley,//Too much water there?,2106,question
Will,There’s a lot of water there. But it’s less than seven eleven.,2106,statement
Will,"But it’s, like, just a bit. …what do you mean, you can’t even filter this water?",2106,question
Oleg,Because it is very muddy and polluted water with small particles ... mineral.,2106,statement
Will,Mhm.,2106,backchannel
Oleg,"That is, if you filter it, it will take me more than 60%.",2106,statement
Will,Mhm.,2106,backchannel
Ashley,What about right under it – at nineteen twenty-eight?,2106,question
Will,Nineteen twenty-eight? Let’s take a look.,2106,statement
Oleg,"That is, if there are some large inclusions, then there is a loss of 10-30%. And when they are like this there, then it’s 60% loss.",2106,statement
Will,Mhm.,2106,backchannel
Ashley,That has a //higher accessibility rate.,2106,statement
Vika,No.,2106,statement
Will,No.,2106,statement
Ashley,Really?,2106,question
Will,No.,2106,statement
Vika,Yes.,2106,statement
Will,There is no water.,2106,statement
Vika,//A lot of contamination.,2106,statement
Ashley,//[UI] it’s so interesting.,2106,statement
Vika,Hm?,2106,question
Ashley,"It’s so interesting. It’s only one…one number off, and it makes such a difference.",2106,statement
Will,I don’t think that’s how it works.,2106,statement
Ashley,"It’s not real, I know. But I’m just saying, like…",2106,statement
Ashley,"Oh, my goodness!",2106,statement
Oleg,O!,2106,statement
Vika,Hmm…,2106,floor-grabber
Oleg,"I was thinking where is that meteorologist. Here he is. There, take that! [UI] too, right?",2106,question
Vika,Damn! …Mechanical engineer.,2106,statement
Will,Materials specialist.,2106,statement
Vika,Materials specialist.,2106,statement
Salah,"And you? Hydrologist, right?",2106,question
Vika,Hm?,2106,question
Ashley,Yep. Hydrogeologist.,2106,statement
Salah,Hydrogeologist.,2106,statement
Ashley,"They’re really not responsive today, huh?",2106,question
Salah,Yeah.,2106,backchannel
Will,Okay. They are logging in from different locations. Interesting.,2106,statement
Ashley,Yeah. Last time they mentioned that.,2106,statement
Salah,Did they mention this?,2106,question
Ashley,To him they mentioned it. Who is actually responding to you?,2106,question
Will,Structural geologist.,2106,statement
Salah,They respond only [UI],2106,disruption
Vika,I don’t know why I can’t create a new point.,2106,statement
Salah,"So, nineteen twenty-nine was okay?",2106,question
Ashley,It’s not bad. Yeah.,2106,statement
Salah,For me it’s okay.,2106,statement
Ashley,"So, we have three options.",2106,statement
Salah,This is the best one.,2106,statement
Will,"Yeah. Nineteen twenty-nine. Well, this ... this means that we are losing 60%. This means that we will have at the end ... This is not clear. If we lose it from the very beginning... I don’t know. It seems... it seems to work fine. Forty thousand or something...",2106,statement
Salah,What’s the loss of water?,2106,question
Will,66%. But there is like three hundred thousand there.,2106,statement
Salah,"Yeah, but the depth for me is okay. So, it’s 1.20.",2106,statement
Will,Okay.,2106,statement
Salah,[SL] seven twenty.,2106,statement
Will,"Well, I mean... Simply put, I want to know if it’s completely... not at all?",2106,question
Oleg,No. The losses will be at the maximum.,2106,statement
Will,Maximum.,2106,statement
Oleg,60%,2106,statement
Will,"Yes, yes, yes.",2106,statement
Oleg,"So, that means",2106,floor-grabber
Will,Okay.,2106,statement
Oleg,"the filtering system allows for filtering, but in this case it is too contaminated with small ones.",2106,statement
Will,"Well, because there’s a lot of water there. So if it was another point where there is less water, I would say, like…",2106,statement
Vika,Less water.,2106,statement
Will,Hm?,2106,question
Vika,You’d say: “Less water”,2106,floor-grabber
Oleg,No.,2106,statement
Will,No. //Then I would say that there is no reason to waste time on this. And if there is so much water...,2106,statement
Vika,//Or you would say that there is no water.,2106,statement
Oleg,"Well, okay.",2106,statement
Will,But it’s in the third place already. This is already far from the other ones that we have.,2106,statement
Oleg,"But if you look at the remaining forty percent, will that allow you to provide the population with water?",2106,question
Will,"Well, yes. It looks like it will work with some water. There are so many... there are three thousand... There we lose... two-thirds. So there is a hundred thousand left. And 60%... forty thousand is somehow, somewhere in a normal place. I mean, it’s not much, but it’s... It’s the same if we have another one, where we have a different level of loss or something.",2106,statement
Will,"[SL] Okay. …Operations is still [UI]. Okay, cool. They are currently saying…I said…They said that both…",2106,statement
Oleg,So then? Shall we pick this one?,2106,question
Will,"They said seven eleven and ten thirty weren’t the best places to build anything, but I told them that, like, “I understand, but seven eleven and ten thirty are our",2106,question
Will,"first ones. So if we can’t find anything better, then we have to choose one of them.”",2106,statement
Ashley,Is it from those that we suggested?,2106,question
Will,Yes. Yeah.,2106,statement
Salah,"Operations specialist said, “Seven eleven is pretty bad for me and some people on my side.”",2106,statement
Vika,Seven eleven?,2106,question
Salah,Yeah. It’s bad for them.,2106,statement
Ashley,"Well, fine.",2106,statement
Vika,And ten thirty?,2106,question
Salah,Still waiting for their reply.,2106,statement
Vika,Hm.,2106,statement
Oleg,They are now considering ten thirty.,2106,statement
Will,Hold on.,2106,statement
Oleg,Seven eleven – no water.,2106,statement
Vika,What do they mean no water?,2106,question
Oleg,Huh?,2106,question
Vika,Why no water?,2106,question
Oleg,"Well, the mechanical says that for some reason.",2106,statement
Salah,"So, the scenario of the [UI] everything is just to look for a point? There is no scenario for constructing the well?",2106,question
Ashley,Seems like it. I don’t know. We can ask Reynold.,2106,statement
Salah,[UI] for every task.,2106,statement
Ashley,Yes. I don’t know. Maybe it would be useful to ask them to give us some feedback.,2106,statement
Vika,There’s a lot of water there.,2106,statement
Will,Where?,2106,question
Vika,Seven eleven.,2106,statement
Will,Seven eleven?,2106,question
Vika,Yes.,2106,statement

Salah,Ten?,2106,question
Oleg,Ten thirty.,2106,statement

Ashley,Thirteen thirty-eight.,2106,statement
Oleg,"Yes, it’s great.",2106,statement
Vika,Guys.,2106,statement
Will,There is a little bit of water there. Not a lot. Let me take a look.,2106,statement
Vika,Thirteen thirty-eight. Can you take a look at thirty-three eighteen?,2106,question
Ashley,Yes. Once I get these off.,2106,statement
Vika,Mhm.,2106,backchannel
Will,It’s not too bad. It’s not a lot but.,2106,statement
Vika,Which one?,2106,question

Will,Nice. I’m about it.,2109,statement

Igor,//You can change it. You can suggest your own.,2101,statement
Ashley,"//Do I know, okay, so…would this be life changing down here?",2101,question
Ryan,You will define green cells and then your decision calculator will update based on that location.,2101,statement
Ashley,Oh.,2101,statement
Ryan,"[UI] So, people might say: “Can we look into this for this team?”, and then you’ll go to that location //and enter the coordinates that you think are best.",2101,statement
Man3,//[SL] can see that I am here.,2101,statement
Oleg,"//[SL] Zhenya, I mean, Lyosha, look here, from the other side …[UI] but there is a slope here that is difficult to access. How can…",2101,statement

Alex,//Yes.,2101,statement
Salah,"Yeah, but the thing is, like, // as I’m telling the material specialist…but that is, like, where are they going to choose this point? Who depends on that location at my point? The thing is, they…I don’t [UI]. At least the commander, who will say to choose that one or that one.",2101,statement
Alex,"//Look here, I will show you [Ui]",2101,statement
Oleg,"//Yes, here it is. It’s right here. See, it is a large one here? Large ones are much easier to evaluate, but at the same time //here…but we do not need filtration here. If [UI] is large, less of it remains under pressure.",2101,statement
Ashley,"//Umm, okay. The things I want to look at: no dust, not any type of volcanoes in microclimate.",2101,statement

Igor,[UI] can answer.,2101,statement

Vika,Which one?,2101,question
Salah,To be considered about what type exactly I can choose for the drilling methods,2101,disruption
Salah,"and we will see the depth. Moreover, it will be more for the time drill, so these things we have to consider about. This my…our main object. And, for example, the availability of that water.",2101,statement
Ashley,Okay.,2101,statement
Oleg,"This is all clear, but initially we need to decide on the location, and there is a proposal to use the location,",2101,statement
Oleg,"that is on the plain. Considering that the parameters that, for example, have now been found with the coordinates thirty-five forty. They have a great depth, but only large [UI]…contaminants. That is, large rocks. It is easier to filter them out and there will be less resistance.",2101,statement
Salah,Mhm.,2101,backchannel
Oleg,"There is a minimum of other contaminants. Consequently, we need a pump only to raise this water. That’s it. And if we look at those locations that are on the slope, there is a very large amount of mineral contaminants and small contaminants. And that will entail",2101,statement
Oleg,a great number of filters,2101,statement
Salah,Yes. Yes.,2101,statement
Oleg,"And, consequently, it will increase the power of the pumps. We don’t need it. And, most importantly, our robots will not be able to work on the slope.",2101,statement
Salah,Operation…specialist. What do you think?,2101,question
Ashley,"Who is the operation specialist? Me? No, I’m //meteorology specialist.",2101,statement

Salah,Yes.,2101,statement
Will,And you want to minimize how much it costs. Correct?,2101,question
Salah,Yeah.,2101,statement
Will,"Okay, so, you have two things: the time of drilling needs to be low, and the second thing is that you minimize cost, correct?",2101,question
Ashley,"Time of drilling, okay.",2101,statement
Salah,Yep.,2101,backchannel
Will,"Yep? To minimize cost, okay. Katya, can you tell me directly, in a few words…",2101,question
Katya,In Russian?,2101,question

Katya,"My main goal is also to minimize the overall cost of robotics. Consequently, I choose and help the group choose a site that will allow them, based on the ground, type of ground locate…",2101,disruption

Ryan,Yes.,2101,statement
Will,"Okay. Good. Now, tell us about your work and…",2101,floor-grabber
Vika,"I am a hydrogeologist. I have three tasks: water quantity, water quality and water use. The amount of water means that we have to help choose a site that will be as large as possible.",2101,statement
Vika,"And the quality of the water means that the composition of the water and contamination are important, and, besides, it is important for me…",2101,floor-grabber
Will,So …,2101,disruption
Vika,"Ease of use. That is, the convenience of wells for future inhabitants of Mars.",2101,statement
Will,Okay.,2101,statement
Vika,"That is, the maximum number of people should receive water.",2101,statement
Oleg,"Now, what do we want? Do we want each one to speak about their specialization?",2101,question
Will,"So that we understand, //what is important for each one of us.",2101,statement
Oleg,"//Who does what, yes.",2101,statement
Katya,Yes.,2101,statement
Will,So. It’s the quantity of water. It is…,2101,statement
Vika,Yes,2101,floor-grabber
Will,It was…were they your activities or is it a group activity?,2101,question
Vika,"It’s mine, mine.",2101,statement
Will,And it is also there…is it also written there? Can I?,2101,question
Vika,"Well, yes.",2101,statement
Will,"Oh, I can’t see yours, yes. And how about…okay, I’m just clarifying here. So, …what…what specification is the most important one for you in this?",2101,question
Maybe Oleg,[SL] Also.,2101,statement
Vika,These are the specifications. The most important one is…,2101,statement
Oleg,[UI].,2101,statement
Vika,"what I listed. It’s the impurities; it’s the flow of water. That is, I need to determine in which layers",2101,statement
Will,Okay.,2101,statement
Vika,we need to be located. That’s the most important thing.,2101,statement
Will,"Good. Okay, I will continue then. If you didn’t catch that,",2101,statement
Will,"her goals fit deeply with the actual task force as the hydrologist. So, the amount of water that is coming out. Is it the quality of the water?",2101,question
Vika,"Yes, water quality and water contamination.",2101,statement
Will,The quality of the water and the contamination of water. And the third one?,2101,question
Vika,"Well, also as many people as possible should receive…",2101,statement
Will,"And how much water flow. So, it’s when…Okay. Now, what is this here //some things…",2101,statement
Katya,"//So, the location does matter, correct? For you.",2101,question
Vika,"Well, by these parameters [UI]",2101,question
Salah,Depth.,2101,statement
Will,"So, yeah. Those follow very closely with the task force goals themselves. So, this tracks the group’s goals. Okay. For me, it is how much water this place loses. That is, it’s some point. How much it loses; how much it…",2101,statement
Oleg,Loses what?,2101,statement
Will,Water from a certain point.,2101,statement
Will,"Yes? So, the amount of water that it loses. Now…",2101,question
Ashley,The amount of water that the well loses?,2101,question
Will,"Yes, so…not the well – the area. So, how [SL] promitable it is. So, essentially, average water loss. So, and…shoot, how can I look this up quickly; how can I translate this into Russian?",2101,question
Ashley,Remind me what your title is.,2101,statement
Salah,And your job is?,2101,question
Will,Sedimentologist.,2101,statement
Will,What? What?,2101,question
Salah,And your job is?,2101,question
Will,Sedimentologist.,2101,statement
Alex,Here are the answers.,2101,statement
Will,Average water loss – //that’s it’s called.,2101,statement
Oleg,//And then [UI] corrected.,2101,statement
Will,"And loss at recharge. So, also the recharge loss and that depends on, again, loss related to [SL] promitability here. So, you’ll see that come up. And intrasource flow loss or loss of low in the source. So, the water going in between the two, which…",2101,statement
Will,"you’ll see that as CA or UCA. Okay. Well, what is this…",2101,statement
Ashley,Yours is complicated.,2101,statement
Will,"Well, I think we’re all complicated. Maybe I’m just making it more complicated myself, so…Alright, now…Okay.",2101,statement
Ryan,"So, pay attention real quick. Pay attention to your chats if you’re not already. Teammates from Chicago will be communicating with you there.",2101,statement
Salah,"So, we should answer them all or…",2101,floor-grabber
Ryan,Answer them. Communicate what they are saying to the rest of the group. \,2101,statement
Oleg,"[UI]. Oh, interacting.",2101,statement
Ryan,If there is something important.,2101,statement
Salah,They say: “Hello from Chicago! Are you from Moscow?”,2101,question
Alex,"From Moscow, from Moscow!",2101,statement
Salah,"From Mars, yeah?",2101,question
Vika,From Moscow.,2101,statement
Oleg,So…,2101,disruption
Woman1,[SL]What? It disappeared??,2101,question
Ryan,We have twenty-five minutes to choose the location for the well.,2101,statement
Woman1,//It disappeared?,2101,question
Ashle,"//No, it’s there. It’s there. It’s just different chats, yeah.",2101,statement
Woman1,"Oh, okay.",2101,statement
Ashley,//I think that if I do the…,2101,disruption
Alex,"//[SL] Twenty-five minutes, he says.",2101,statement
Woman1,"Oh, wow!",2101,statement
Oleg,To find points?,2101,question
Ryan,"//You have twenty-five minutes, and we’ll start the signoff process for the final well location.",2101,statement
Igor,Twenty-fives are left to agree. To choose a point.,2101,statement
Ashley,Just making sure [UI] is talking to me. Just like in the //factors team. Yes.,2101,statement
Will,//Okay.,2101,statement
Salah,"So, who should we talk to?",2101,question
Will,How’s that…,2101,floor-grabber
Igor,"Pay attention to the messages you receive from your group. And, in some cases, it is sometimes useful to voice them for the whole team here.",2101,statement
Will,"Yeah, so, I will see. I am now seeing that the people from the team of geologists – they said that they already have some points.",2101,statement
Will,"So, from the geologists…the geology team we already…they are saying that they already have some suggestions and coordinates. So, just FYI. I’m sure we all have heard a few things from our teams thus far. But, yes, we do have some suggestions about coordinates coming from geology team at this point. Continue.",2101,statement
Oleg,"Now, I have received a message from the engineering group, in which they say that they are waiting for the decision of the geologists regarding the location, and then they are trying…",2101,statement
Oleg,Or they will start working according to the rules that were specified.,2101,statement
Will,"Okay. I told them – from the geologist group – that within fifteen or twenty minutes we would have some idea. So, now let’s continue.",2101,statement
Oleg,Yes.,2101,statement
Will,What are your activities?,2101,question
Oleg,My activity is to use the knowledge and experience about the projective filtering system.,2101,statement
Will,What is it called?,2101,question
Oleg,Biomechanical engineer.,2101,statement
Will,Okay.,2101,statement
Ashley,You said biochemical?,2101,question
Oleg,Yes.,2101,statement
Will,Biochemical or…,2101,floor-grabber
Oleg,"Consequently, my responsibilities include designing a filtration system based on the characteristics of the ground to be taken; and what filtration steps we will implement.",2101,statement
Will,"Okay. So, the first point, the most important thing is what exactly?",2101,question
Oleg,We need to determine from what ground and from what location we will take it.,2101,statement
Oleg,"in order to further determine the power of the pump, //that will be suitable.",2101,statement
Will,"Okay, so, I take it the first one is the ground? Yes. //Through which...",2101,statement
Oleg,"//Yes, the ground and what is in it. How contaminated water will pass through it. And I need to determine the number of steps and the quality of the filters.",2101,statement
Will,"Okay, so, the first thing that we’re looking at here, is the soil, the quality of the soil and how much… I mean, pump water…how it can pump water…",2101,statement
Oleg,"Yes, it is important for me that I understand the quality of the water //and how to filter it.",2101,statement
Will,"//And the quality of water. So, the type of soil and the quality of water that comes out of soil.",2101,statement
Oleg,"In the future, how many steps I should take to ensure the filtration of this water.",2101,statement
Will,Okay.,2101,statement
Oleg,"And, in the future, determine how many steps I will use to filter this water.",2101,statement
Will,"That is, //stages – like, one time, two times…",2101,floor-grabber
Oleg,"//Stages. Yes, yes, yes. The thing is that there are several of them",2101,statement
Oleg,types of filtration.,2101,statement
Will,Okay.,2101,statement
Oleg,"Rough, fine and with all the [UI]",2101,disruption
Will,And how many layers the actual…,2101,floor-grabber
Igor,filtration.,2101,statement
Oleg,Yes.,2101,statement
Will,Filtration has…//filtration?,2101,question
Igor,//Stages of filtration.,2101,statement
Will,Okay. Good.,2101,statement
Oleg,"And, it is very important, so as not to re-read here, it is very important that the water is less contaminated with small things. For example, mineral contaminants or sand, because it will clog the filters and, consequently, it will require an increase in the power of the pumps.",2101,statement
Will,So.,2101,statement
Will,"Ground type, water quality and filtration levels.",2101,statement
Oleg,"Yes. Well, first, maybe... remove the ground, because this is already a derivative of what there will be in the water. Remove the ground. Take away.",2101,statement
Will,But this…What did you find out when reading? What was it exactly?,2101,question
Oleg,I need the degree of water contamination and the degree of filtration.,2101,statement
Will,"So, the quality of the water and the stages…",2101,floor-grabber
Oleg,Filtration.,2101,statement
Will,Filtration. Okay. And the stages of filtration.,2101,statement
Ryan,Did you all get these quizzes that pop up?,2101,question
Ryan,You need to complete them as you’re working.,2101,statement
Igor,There will sometimes be questions on the screen. You need to answer.,2101,statement
Will,"So, okay. //So, did you catch that? Quality of water and the filtration stages //the water has to go through to be of quality.",2101,statement
Salah,//Filtration stages and the quality of water.,2101,statement
Will,"okay, so…",2101,statement
Oleg,Now who?,2101,question
Alex,To whom [SL] do you extend your idea?,2101,question
Will,"So, now we are listening to Ashley. Let’s continue. We’ll listen to Ashley real quick. //Ashley, go ahead and give us your shot.",2101,statement
Ashley,"//Yeah, just really quickly. So,",2101,statement
Oleg,What is the position?,2101,question
Will,//What?,2101,question
Oleg,What’s the name of the position?,2101,question
Will,Biomechanical…this should be in front of it,2101,floor-grabber
Will,"//on the first page. On the first page. //There, it was like…",2101,statement
Salah,//Meteorologist.,2101,statement
Oleg,No. We each have different ones.,2101,statement
Will,"Yes, yes, yes. And you?",2101,question
Oleg,I have the biological engineer.,2101,statement

Will,Biochemical.,2101,statement
Ashley,He is sedimentologist.,2101,statement
Will,"Sedimentologist. Ash, go ahead.",2101,statement
Ashley,"Alright. So, basically, I am part of the space human factors team. Specifically, the Martian meteorology specialist. //Which means…",2101,statement
Will,"//Okay. So, she is a meteorologist for Mars.",2101,statement
Ashley,"Which means that I focus on the microclimates of Mars. So, the dust storms that affect the water quality, for example. And so, I am trying to minimize the meteorology costs",2101,statement
Will,minimize…,2101,statement
Ashley,that are associated with using the wells.,2101,statement
Salah,okay.,2101,statement
Will,What kind of costs specifically?,2101,question
Ashley,"So, basically, I would help with choosing an optimal location with minimal dust storms, for example.",2101,statement
Will,Okay. Minimize…How can I say it? Storms or…//sand?,2101,question
Ashley,//Encouraging also,2101,question

Salah,Yeah. She is going to look in that…,2101,floor-grabber
Ashley,"Yeah, sure. I mean, yeah. …Yeah, I mean…",2101,statement
Will,Does that fit? Okay.,2101,question
Ashley,Yeah.,2101,backchannel
Salah,Same the…,2101,floor-grabber
Ashley,Minimize the amount of training that we have to give qualities [SL] of colony.,2101,statement
Will,Okay.,2101,statement
Will,"So, minimize …like areas of better weather, we could say?",2101,question
Ashley,"Sure, yeah. I mean, we can generalize that. Yeah.",2101,statement
Will,"Okay, next point then, one more time.",2101,statement
Ashley,"So, yeah. Yeah, so, location, low-cost robots to do the drilling.",2101,statement
Salah,Yeah.,2101,backchannel
Ashley,"You know, low costs on the type of the pump that we actually choose. And then, also the lower cost for the type of training that we give the inhabitants of the colony.",2101,statement
Will,Minimizing cost of robots; minimizing cost of pump.,2101,statement
Ashley,"Type of pump, yeah.",2101,statement
Will,Okay.,2101,statement
Ashley,And type of training.,2101,statement
Will,Okay. Minimizing…or specifying or minimizing the type of or the amount of training?,2101,question
Ashley,Minimizing. Like…just. It doesn’t get to mention just that.,2101,statement
Will,She wants to minimize.,2101,statement
Ashley,The cost associated with the type of training given.,2101,statement
Will,"Minimize, like…training costs. So that all of it works. Is this all clear more or less?",2101,question

Katya,Yes.,2101,statement
Will,Okay.,2101,statement
Will,"Minimizing cost of training. Okay. Cost of training. Okay, now that’s all of us.",2101,statement
Vika,"One thing, though, yes…In short, I was wrong. In general, I have a slightly different…",2101,statement
Will,"Okay, so it was us who got confused. It turns out that Vika has some different tasks. Vika double checked what she needed to do and it turns out that she actually had some additional…",2101,statement
Vika,"Yeah, so…type of water… impurities. //I need to study the impurities...",2101,statement
Oleg,"//So, you are…",2101,statement
Will,Wait. What’s there?,2101,question
Salah,Type of water?,2101,question
Vika,I need to study the impurities. The impurities in the water.,2101,statement
Igor,Contaminants.,2101,statement
Will,Okay. Okay.,2101,statement
Vika,"But, specifically, it is contamination and…",2101,floor-grabber
Will,"Check it. If you want, check it. It’s in English. Because it makes sense there.",2101,statement
Vika,I want to do that. I also need to determine the water layers.,2101,statement

Oleg,Ashley.,2101,statement
Ashley,What?,2101,question
Oleg,What is it mainly for you? Is it looking for the spot where it will be?,2101,question
Ashley,"Yes, //because the weather will vary on Mars.",2101,statement
Oleg,"//Yes, yes.",2101,statement
Vika,// And it is what waterfall will depend on.,2101,statement

Vika,//but this [UI]. And…,2101,statement
Ashley,What?,2101,question
Oleg,Do you have the same map?,2101,question
Ashley,"Yes, yes. But //I still need to finish it here.",2101,statement
Oleg,//While they are figuring it out there.,2101,statement
Vika,// I will also need to determine the impurities that are contained in this water.,2101,statement
Will,"So, okay. Contamination. So, okay. So, it’s... If we define it, it’s not so different.",2101,statement
Will,than what Vika had already.,2101,statement
Vika,//It was a clarification.,2101,statement
Vika,//I had a more general one.,2101,statement
Will,// How much will come out of this point of water – from the source. And how much is ... What is the name? Impu…,2101,statement
Vika,Impurities.,2101,statement
Will,"Impurities, yes. Impurities. How contaminated is the water. Okay, so. Now we understand everything that is important to us. If someone has questions, you can ask, but now we need to determine finally, as I understand it, where it is. Now, we already...",2101,statement
Oleg,"Yes, now we need to understand who from our team is responsible for the location and controls the rovers in order to get there. To conduct reconnaissance of the place where the water intake will be carried out.",2101,statement
Will,Okay. Rovers – it is…,2101,statement
Vika,//And who is who in terms of the roles now?,2101,question

Will,"So, we need to figure out, I guess, who is going to take the rover and figure out the location of this place.",2101,statement
Salah,"Yeah, but the thing is I have just in chat the location they gave me. [SL] the grade.",2101,statement
Salah,"So, I’m going to use that grade and will do my decision for which rover we should choose.",2101,statement

Ashley,"Maybe we can, but the chat is not…the chat is not…",2101,floor-grabber
Will,"So, right now what I see here, it says “minus one” – “minus one minus one”. Therefore, I don’t think that they chose this. So…what do we do?",2101,question
Oleg,"The fact is that if we have not decided on a location now, we no longer have the opportunity to choose a location. The extreme one that we have confirmed, we must calculate and see how much we can use. If we have it weather-wise, perhaps, but some problems are possible ...",2101,statement

Will,"Okay, so, I mean, how do we…is there a process for converging? How do we add in the map cell? Do we all choose the same one? What’s the actual process for converging?",2101,question
Igor,Ryan?,2101,question
Will,Is that something you could answer or is this something we should know already?,2101,question
Ryan,They should…they should be saying it in the chat. [SL] It’s so mixed up.,2101,statement

Igor,The mechanics of signing off.,2101,statement
Ashley,"I think, you just click your name.",2101,statement
Ryan,"Yeah, you just click you name. The checkbox next to your name.",2101,statement

Ashley,"Okay, sorry.",2101,statement
Will,How do we choose? How do we know what site has been chosen?,2101,question
Ashley,"Yeah. I’m just about to ask them that. But, by the way…so, the last I heard was forty-one seventeen. I’m good with that one. I let them know that from my perspective I’m good with that, and now I’m asking them: “How do we know that I want to sign off [UI] assessing that location?”",2101,question

Video,"Due to channel restriction… The Project Red Relay is a complex network routing task. Once your task force has planned the water infrastructure on Mars, you will be routing information to the mission analysis group back on Earth. Due to channel restriction issues, you will only have direct contact with two of the individuals in your task force. Twelve individuals, including your six-person Sirius crew and six mission support members. In the Project Red Relay",2101,statement
Video,"you will choose two people who will be most effective in helping you relay any information you receive to anyone else in the larger group. Remember, each other person in the task force is also choosing two people to maintain communication with. You will complete two information relay tasks. Each one will last for ten minutes. You will receive multiple pieces of information, will need to use your two contacts to route the message to the appropriate specialist within your task force.",2101,statement
Video,"After the first ten-minute relay task the communication channels will be reset. You will have the option to choose two different people to maintain communication with during the second relay task. The first thing you’ll need to do is log in as your assigned Project RED role. For example, if you are a materials specialist, select the “materials specialist” option from dropdown list. Next, you’ll be asked to select two contacts. All the task force participants will be listed in this menu.",2101,statement
Video,"From the menu you will choose the two people who you think will be most effective in helping you relay information to the larger group based on their selected contact. When all of the users have selected their contacts, the session will begin. Your job will be to route information toward it’s intended final recipient by choosing which of your two contacts you should send it to. As soon as the task begins, you will receive a message from the system, containing information that another task",2101,statement
Video,"force member needs. You’ll see that this message has a final recipient indicated at the top and includes a file attachment containing data regarding the mission. Don’t worry about opening the attachment. Your job is simply to forward the message to the contact that you feel is best situated given his or her own contacts to get it to its final recipient. Choose which of your contacts you want to send it to and forward the message. Meanwhile,",2101,statement
Video,"keep your eyes on your inbox, because as you are sending files to your contacts, others who chose you as a contact, will be sending messages to you to relay it to others. The message will show who you received it from, its path so far and the intended final recipient. Again, you’ll need to relay the message to the contact that you think is best situated, based on the contacts that person chose to get this message to its final recipient.

Contacts with more messages in their inbox might be slower at relaying messages you send to them.",2101,statement
Video,"After ten minutes the first task will end. When the session ends you will be taken back to the main page. You will then take part in the second Project RED Relay task. Select your assigned role again and click Log In. due to channel limitations you once again will be able to select two people in the task force, who you want to be able to help route your messages to the rest of the task force. You may select the same contacts as the first time, or you may choose different ones.",2101,statement

Katya,"Yes, please.",2101,statement
Igor,"Please, what?",2101,question
Katya,Please translate everything.,2101,statement
Igor,"Sure. I will translate everything that’s the most important things. That is, firstly, I will start by saying that this is part of Project RED, but, in fact, it has nothing to do with the first part. The task here is to send and forward messages. You don’t need or have to read them. That is, there is no sense ... that is, there is no meaning in the content of the messages that are transmitted.",2101,statement
Igor,"The only link to the previous task is the twelve people and the twelve roles. In total, you have a team of twelve people: six here and six there. Well, plus there are six more somewhere, right? A total of twelve. You have limited communication channels. You can send information to only two contacts who you need to determine ahead of time. That is, you choose two people from the list of eleven people from the very beginning who you think, for some",2101,statement
Igor,"reason, will communicate messages to someone else as efficiently as possible. That is, the rest of the crew or team members. Periodically, once every two minutes, you will receive a message that is generated by the system that will need to be transferred to someone else. The address will be listed there. That is, the final recipient of this message. You need to choose one of your contacts that you think based on all the information you have",2101,statement
Igor,"information at that moment can effectively pass them on so that it reaches the addressee. You can see at any time where the messages are getting and how effectively those that you have already sent have been transmitted. The whole history of messages ... they can travel in circles, too. Theoretically, it may not reach the addressee. There may not be a logical chain to the addressee. You will see where it came from, who it passed through, and how it got to you.",2101,statement
Igor,"You can also see the workload of your two specific recipients. That is, how many unsent messages they have. The higher this number, the slower they are likely to work. Well, or more loaded with work. Or maybe they were just chosen, and therefore they have ... well, this should be taken into account when making decisions. That is, a message arrives, you address it to one of the two people, and you hope that it will reach the right place along the chain. That’s what this task is.",2101,statement
Igor,It will be performed twice. Ten minutes each session.,2101,statement
Oleg,"That is, some message is launched and we...",2101,statement
Igor,"Some message is launched, a new message is periodically reset and comes to you. Plus, you may be receiving messages. It’s not possibly, but you probably will...",2101,statement
Oleg,"And, in fact, you observe whether this message has come to the addressee or not.",2101,statement
Igor,"Whether it came or it didn’t come, yes. That is, you are someone’s contact too. You don’t know how many people will choose you as a contact. Yes? That is, so you can track",2101,statement
Igor,"where it came from, so that back and forth it ... As if, if ... without the need to send it.",2101,statement

Vika,"Yes, no water. Alright, alright!",2119,statement
Salah,Do you have to calculate before you make sure that there is no water? Or is it…,2119,question
Will,"No, no, no. So, at first, you check if there is water at all. Then you check the average water loss. //So, a zero in the amount of water, it is too little, then you don’t worry about it. If the average water loss is too high, then it doesn’t matter. You look at the amount of available water and then you look at the average water loss and you say: Okay, does this look in general like there is an amount of water…",2119,statement

Salah,"Hm, okay.",2119,backchannel
Will,"So, one hundred percent water loss.",2119,statement
Vika,Oh.,2119,statement

Oleg,So there are problems with water.,2119,statement

Oleg,Is there a better one?,2119,question
Vika,Not yet.,2119,statement
Will,I thought that five twenty-two is our best one now.,2119,statement
Vika,"Well, for now, yes, but…",2119,floor-grabber
Ashley,What about ten forty-two?,2119,question
Will,"It’ll do, but it is not the best one.",2119,statement
Oleg,What if we try five thirty…,2119,floor-grabber
Vika,It seems to me that ten forty-two is better. //But there is less water there at ten forty-two.,2119,statement

Will,OK.,2119,statement
Vika,"I agree with this one, but…",2119,disruption
Oleg,"But, if…",2119,floor-grabber
Vika,The water area is smaller there.,2119,statement
Oleg,"There. But if it is eight nineteen, more can be cleaned, but there will be more loss.",2119,statement
Will,Hold on.,2119,statement
Oleg,The water is very murky there.,2119,statement
Vika,I am for five twenty-two.,2119,statement

Vika,Part of the crew. [UI].,2119,statement
Salah,"So, which one is the best one?",2119,question
Will,"So, five twenty-two is the best for us. Eight nineteen is doable. So, now we just have to wait for them.",2119,statement
Ashley,What about ten forty-two? Is that not good for you all?,2119,question
Will,Ten forty-two…that’s okay but it’s in the third place.,2119,statement
Ashley,Hm. Fine.,2119,statement
Ashley,It’s the best one for me. Darn it!,2119,statement
Vika,I…,2119,disruption

Vika,Just a second.,2119,statement
Ashley,One more time.,2119,statement
Vika,Not bad.,2119,statement
Oleg,Forty-six twenty-four.,2119,statement

Ashley,"Oh, I like that one a lot.",2119,statement
Will,"What was the number again, Salah?",2119,question
Salah,Six forty.,2119,statement
Will,Six forty. Okay. It’s not a lot of water. It’s pretty low. It’s maybe about a quarter of one of the other ones. It’s functional but it’s not…,2119,statement
Vika,"So, we’re working on these points. I mean, that we have.",2119,statement
Salah,Which point?,2119,question
Will,Five twenty-two and eight nineteen. We just have to wait.,2119,statement
Salah,Okay. Five twenty-two…,2119,statement
Vika,Okay.,2119,statement

Vika,And do they agree to…,2119,floor-grabber
Salah,Which one?,2119,question
Vika,I can’t look it up.,2119,statement

Will,They have not responded.,2119,statement
Vika,"Yes, oops.",2119,statement
Will,It is mine.,2119,statement
Vika,This one is yours.,2119,statement

Vika,I knew that.,2119,statement
Oleg,"And what about this one, twenty forty-one?",2119,question
Will,There is no water.,2119,statement
Vika,"I almost dialed the second number. It is too bad, we can’t play music.",2119,statement

Will,Which one is in Thailand?,2119,question

Will,"Well, we have three spots where there is some.",2119,statement
Ashley,"Is there like a good water amount in ours or, like…",2119,disruption
Will,They seem to like both of them. Eight nineteen and five twenty-two.,2119,statement
Ashley,But it’s like…how much water loss do we actually have there?,2119,question
Will,"We actually end up with quite a bit of water. For five twenty-two we end up with hundred thousand. That’s actually the size, as somebody said, of the aquifer after the loss. For eight nineteen we end up eighty-two thousand, which is decent.",2119,statement
Ashley,Will they ask about the ‘aquifires’ thing? What does that mean?,2119,question
Will,The what?,2119,question
Ashley,The “aquafires” or something. Because I know they ask…,2119,statement
Will,The aquifers?,2119,question
Ashley,Yeah. What does that mean?,2119,question
Will,"An aquifer is a…It’s like a space or a…like an area of rock that holds water. So, you can have aquifers that are deep or aquifers that are higher, but basically its where water sits inside…inside rock. It can be, basically, like a cavernous type deal or it can be…actually be within the rock itself.",2119,statement
Will,"Okay, so, they are checking out five twenty-two.",2119,statement
Vika,"Oh, that is it. Cool.",2119,statement
Oleg,Here is another good one – thirty twenty-six…Is there some there?,2119,question

Ashley,Okay.,2119,statement
Oleg,"So, this time they decided not to resist. Just agree and that’s it.",2119,statement
Will,"No, they were considering five twenty-two and eight nineteen.",2119,statement
Oleg,And you have a lot of loss at five twenty-two?,2119,question
Will,"Fifty-four, but it should be visible there. Geology calculated value is 54% water loss, but we have two thousand twenty-eight, so it means…",2119,statement
Oleg,"It is the water reserves, right?",2119,question
Will,"Yes, so we have a lot of water there.",2119,statement
Oleg,How large a colony is it sufficient for?,2119,question
Will,Two thousand eight hundred now.,2119,statement
Oleg,"And we need to provide for up to ten thousand, right?",2119,question

Vika,//Seventeen thirty-eight.,2105,statement
Will,"Yes, yes, yes. Seventeen thirty-eight.",2105,statement
Will,I got this wrong. It was seventeen thirty-nine.,2105,statement
Oleg,Yes.,2105,statement
Will,The one I was talking about. It was okay. Seventeen thirty-eight — no. I mixed it up when I was saying that.,2105,statement
Vika,So you mean seventeen thirty-eight ...,2105,statement
Will,Yeah.,2105,backchannel
Ashley,Oh. Because they're talking about “thirty-eight” now.,2105,statement
Vika,Oopie.,2105,statement
Salah,Which point?,2105,question

Vika,Nineteen thirty-five.,2105,statement
Salah,//Will agreed.,2105,statement
Ashley,//Thirty-four.,2105,statement
Vika,One minute. Don’t remember.,2105,statement
Ashley,Thirty-four.,2105,statement
Vika,I have already removed that point. Therefore it didn't fit me. Very high contamination. It wouldn’t work.,2105,statement
Ashley,"Ah, too much contamination, she says.",2105,statement
Vika,Yeah.,2105,backchannel
Oleg,"Yes, it is too high. If only there were sixty at least.",2105,statement
Vika,So…,2105,floor-grabber
Ashley,Have you looked at twenty-five three?,2105,question
Vika,Twenty-five three? It’s fine.,2105,statement
Ashley,Is it okay for you?,2105,question
Will,Twenty-five...,2105,statement
Vika,Yes. And what will Oleg //say about contamination?,2105,question
Ashley,//What do you say?,2105,question
Oleg,"Well, basically, it may work. //Bad, but possible.",2105,statement
Ashley,"//What did you think of twenty-five three? …You, William. //A very important person.",2105,statement
Will,//I’m taking a look. There is water there. Let me just see how much.,2105,statement
Salah,Twenty-five three?,2105,question
Ashley,Mhm.,2105,statement

Ashley,So can we ... can we offer it already or not?,2105,question
Will,It’s not really a lot going on.,2105,statement
Oleg,"[UI]. Please… Well, they want us too…",2105,disruption
Vika,"Okay. It is a Sign Off, right?",2105,question
Will,No. //It’s just…,2105,statement
Ashley,//Not yet. They just... We don't start it. We're just still discussing.,2105,statement
Vika,Okay.,2105,statement
Vika,Where is our [SL] meteorologist?,2105,question
Ashley,So you didn't like...you don't like twenty-five three?,2105,question
Vika,Not the best point...we reject nineteen thirty-five. Really?,2105,question
Oleg,Nineteen thirty-five. //I wouldn't.,2105,statement
Vika,//It was good.,2105,statement
Oleg,[SL] I wouldn't keep it.,2105,statement
Vika,But there is only large contamination. This means it can be cleaned up.,2105,statement
Oleg,"//These are large. Well, how to say...",2105,statement
Ashley,//What about twenty-seven five?,2105,question
Vika,Twenty-seven five.,2105,statement
Oleg,As for twenty-seven five we don't... I didn't check.,2105,statement
Vika,Me either.,2105,statement

Oleg,"Yes, there will be losses, but, again, everything is being cleaned. Fine.",2105,statement
Vika,Okay.,2105,statement
Will,We lose almost everything. 98% water loss.,2105,statement
Ashley,"Do I need to fix them and tell them it’s seventeen thirty-nine and not seventeen thirty-eight, that they should be looking at?",2105,question
Will,Yes.,2105,statement
Vika,"Can you [UI], right?",2105,question
Oleg,Sure.,2105,statement

Ashley,Twenty-two twelve could work actually.,2105,statement
Will,Twenty-two twelve?,2105,question
Vika,Yes.,2105,statement
Will,Let me see here. //Twenty-two twelve.,2105,statement
Ashley,"//There are red zones. So, the weather leaves much to be desired, but it would go.",2105,statement
Will,"Yeah, twenty-two twelve. There’s not…there is about a fifth of the water than all the other ones.",2105,statement
Salah,And it’s too deep.,2105,statement
Ashley,"//He said, that…",2105,floor-grabber
Vika,//What is “fifth”?,2105,question
Salah,Too deep.,2105,statement

Vika,Yes!,2105,statement
Will,Sixteen eighteen?,2105,question
Ashley,I like it.,2105,statement
Will,"Maybe, but there's half the water. I mean, we want fifty thousand, but... how to call it? Of water...or how should it be measured? In liters or something. And there, in general, there are fifty thousand, but we want that fifty thousand to be used. There are only eighteen that we can use. So, it may work, but I don't know how others will accept this. I know for sure that...",2105,statement
Will,How is it called? Structural geologist would be like “No. ”,2105,question
Vika,Mhm.,2105,backchannel
Ashley,"Vika, you had another point too.",2105,statement
Vika,Nineteen thirty-five.,2105,statement

Vika,Yes.,2105,statement
Will,Seems fine.,2105,statement
Vika,And twenty-five three. //These are the points I have.,2105,statement
Will,"Twenty-five three? Half of what may be on the other, but yes, it is.",2105,statement
Ashley,Twenty-five three?,2105,question
Vika,Yes.,2105,statement
Ashley,"William, did you say it was good?",2105,question
Will,This one would work. I don’t know.,2105,statement
Oleg,//[SL] Nineteen twenty-two is bad.,2105,statement
Ashley,"//It would just be good for me. If it works for you, for Vika, for me... What about Oleg?",2105,question
Oleg,Repeat once again. Which one?,2105,question
Ashley,Twenty-five three. Twenty-five three?,2105,question
Salah,Let me check.,2105,statement
Vika,At nineteen thirty-four there was a high level of contamination. That's why…,2105,floor-grabber
Will,Nineteen thirty-four?,2105,question
Vika,Yes. You just said.,2105,statement
Oleg,No... no...,2105,statement
Vika,But nineteen thirty-five is fine.,2105,statement
Salah,Twenty-five?,2105,question
Ashley,Twenty-five three.,2105,statement
Will,Twenty-five three.,2105,statement
Salah,It’s okay. Good.,2105,statement

Oleg,One minute. I'll tell you now.,2105,statement
Ashley,‘Cause four of us here said that…,2105,floor-grabber
Vika,Oleg also said that it was normal. //That's why I...,2105,statement
Ashley,//You agree?,2105,question
Oleg,Yes.,2105,statement
Ashley,So we can...we say...//we'll tell them twenty-two...twenty-five three. Twenty-five three.,2105,statement
Vika,//Twenty-five three.,2105,statement
Oleg,Yes.,2105,statement
Vika,Alright.,2105,statement
Will,I already offered them. I just....,2105,statement
Ashley,Suggest twenty-five three.,2105,statement
Salah,What’s your title? Your job here.,2105,statement
Ashley,Hydrogeologist. She is.,2105,statement
Salah,Hydro?,2105,question
Ashley,Hydrogeologist…fifteen fifty-three Moscow time.,2105,statement
Will,"Eight twenty-nine, they say here.",2105,statement
Vika,Yes.,2105,statement
Ashley,Eight twenty-nine?,2105,question
Will,Yes.,2105,statement
Ashley,There is something. Maybe.,2105,statement
Vika,Contamination is high and water loss is massive. No.,2105,statement
Oleg,"Yes, if only there were no small ... No turbidity and impurities, then it would be generally superb. Or at least a little lower level of it.",2105,statement
Will,There ain’t any water.,2105,statement
Oleg,Why do we consider it then?,2105,question
Salah,Which point we agreed on?,2105,question
Ashley,Twenty-five three.,2105,statement
Ashley,"And when you chat, are you only talking to your team or other people too?",2105,question
Will,I always inform that I write to my operation specialist.,2105,statement
Ashley,Hm.,2105,statement
Oleg,What do you think about point thirty-eight eighteen?,2105,question
Will,Thirty-eight eighteen.,2105,statement
Ashley,Thirty-eight what?,2105,question
Oleg,Thirty-eight eighteen.,2105,statement
Ashley,Eighteen.,2105,statement
Will,There’s no water.,2105,statement
Oleg,Holy crap!,2105,statement
Oleg,I have almost everything there close to zero. The purest water. That ain’t there.,2105,statement
Ashley,My team says nineteen thirty-four.,2105,statement
Vika,No. It wouldn’t work.,2105,statement
Ashley,Thirty-four? Because we looked at thirty-five.,2105,question
Vika,Yes. We have already checked thirty-four as well. It wouldn’t work.,2105,statement
Will,Nineteen thirty-four?,2105,question
Vika,Yes.,2105,statement
Will,What do you mean? Why?,2105,question
Vika,Thirty....I’m sure. It wouldn’t work. Wait I’ll see why.,2105,statement
Will,There is so much water! //Nineteen thirty-four.,2105,statement
Vika,"//Yes, but there, it seems, too high contamination level.",2105,statement
Ashley,But it could be...,2105,statement
Vika,Just checked.,2105,statement
Will,But if there is so much water...,2105,statement
Ashley,How high? Because maybe we could clean it up.,2105,statement
Vika,One minute.,2105,statement
Will,Because it is the biggest source for us. The biggest one indeed.,2105,statement
Ashley,Yes.,2105,statement
Will,"So if there's a lot of water in there, then it's fine, like...",2105,statement
Vika,"It is very good in terms of yield and loss, but //high level of contamination by small ...",2105,statement
Oleg,//I'm gonna check it.,2105,statement
Ashley,Nineteen thirty-four…,2105,floor-grabber
Vika,//By small particles.,2105,statement
Will,//How high is it?,2105,question
Vika,Oleg will tell if he can clean it.,2105,statement
Oleg,"And, in general, is it possible technically to do this or not.",2105,statement
Salah,Which one?,2105,question
Ashley,We are discussing nineteen thirty-four because that’s what they sent us and…,2105,floor-grabber
Salah,I sent it to them. They discussed and asked.,2105,statement
Ashley,Nineteen thirty-four?,2105,question
Salah,"Yeah. Then, after we discuss with them, they ask me regarding the brand and the drill.",2105,statement
Ashley,"So, //should we send them this?",2105,question
Salah,"So, I answered them…",2105,disruption
Will,//Nuggets.,2105,statement
Ashley,//She said there is high contamination.,2105,statement
Oleg,//I will do it.,2105,statement
Salah,Yeah. Then //she said that there was high contamination.,2105,statement
Vika,//Nineteen thirty-four.,2105,statement
Will,What kind of?,2105,question
Vika,"Guys, nineteen…",2105,floor-grabber

Ashley,Okay.,2105,statement
Will,Shit!,2105,statement
Vika,What’s up? Oh! Can I tag everyone at once? Or not? Okay.,2105,question
Oleg,This is your questionnaire.,2105,statement
Vika,So what? We do it with everyone.,2105,statement
Oleg,Yes.,2105,statement
Ashley,I give the same answers to the questions almost every time.,2105,statement
Oleg,"In fact, we are discussing it among us.",2105,statement
Ashley,Yes.,2105,statement
Oleg,And we have our own team.,2105,statement
Ashley,So my team chose our first offer — seventeen thirty nine...,2105,statement
Oleg,Thirty-eight.,2105,statement
Ashley,We changed it to thirty-nine because William said it was better. They said it was a good option for them.,2105,statement
Vika,And the last one is nineteen thirty-four?,2105,question
Ashley,"It works for them too, but nineteen thirty-four — the weather is worse there. There are big red zones.",2105,statement
Vika,Okay.,2105,statement
Ashley,So what?,2105,question
Vika,And the previous?,2105,question
Ashley,Seventeen thirty-nine //much better.,2105,statement
Vika,//I haven't checked yet. One minute.,2105,statement
Will,Which is better?,2105,question
Ashley,Seventeen thirty-nine is much better for me.,2105,statement
Will,Seventeen thirty-nine?,2105,question
Ashley,The one we discussed at the beginning.,2105,statement
Will,Seventeen thirty-nine?,2105,question
Ashley,Yeah.,2105,statement
Will,Okay. I’ve already got it.,2105,statement
Vika,For some reason I don't have that point.,2105,statement
Oleg,Okay. Turbidity is eighty.,2105,statement
Will,That’s it!,2105,statement
Ashley,Really?,2105,question
Will,"Yeah, I mean, it’s passable for me.",2105,statement
Vika,Seventeen thirty-nine?,2105,question
Ashley,Yes.,2105,statement
Will,Yeah. Do they say seventeen thirty-nine?,2105,question
Ashley,Yeah.,2105,statement
Oleg,Yes. //Possibly.,2105,statement
Ashley,"//So, my team is saying, “Seventeen thirty-nine is// a good option. It seems to work for us, and…”",2105,statement
Vika,//Why are we listening to them?,2105,question
Salah,Which one?,2105,question
Ashle,"// Seventeen thirty-nine, that we said earlier on. That you said that it was good for you too.",2105,statement
Oleg,"//Contamination, impurities. I have one filter which can remove it all.",2105,statement
Vika,Oh really?,2105,question
Oleg,Yes.,2105,statement
Ashley,So is it okay or not?,2105,question
Oleg,"Yes, yes, yes.",2105,statement
Ashley,Yes. He is good.,2105,statement
Oleg,It will be at the limit.,2105,statement
Ashley,Is it really deep for you?,2105,question
Salah,"Still, I didn’t check for it.",2105,statement
Ashley,Seventeen thirty-nine. That might be the one that we converge on.,2105,statement
Will,"He said it was deep, but he said that it was okay.",2105,statement
Ashley,Yep.,2105,backchannel
Vika,"There will be a massive water loss. Is there enough water, Will?",2105,question
Will,What?,2105,question
Oleg,Does seventeen thirty-nine possess a decent amount of water?,2105,question
Will,"Yes, yes, yes.",2105,statement
Vika,"Ah, it’s okay. The loss is within the norm. The loss is fine.",2105,statement
Vika,//Yes. Okay. Seventeen thirty-nine.,2105,statement
Ashley,"//So, maybe we could…Sorry. One of my specialists says that at seventeen thirty-nine it is impossible to fully eliminate…",2105,floor-grabber
Will,Huh?,2105,question
Ashley,Eliminate. How do you say it?,2105,question
Will,What...what…,2105,statement
Ashley,There is no way to completely eliminate contamination with filters and materials at seventeen thirty-nine.,2105,statement
Will,To filter contamination.,2105,statement
Oleg,We have a method. We really do.,2105,statement
Vika,He is unde....,2105,statement
Oleg,The thing is...,2105,statement
Will,Yeah.,2105,backchannel
Oleg,You can write to him that the H filters of the third stage allow you to clean up to 85%.,2105,statement
Ashley,Can you repeat it once again?,2105,question
Oleg,Filters of the group H allow to clean the water up to 85%.,2105,statement
Ashley,Filter H…,2105,statement
Oleg,Up to 85%.,2105,statement
Ashley,…can clean up to 80%? Eighty?,2105,question
Oleg,And five.,2105,statement
Ashley,85%,2105,statement
Ashley,But how much do we need?,2105,question
Oleg,The less the better.,2105,statement
Ashley,Is it a drinking water if it's eighty-five or not?,2105,question
Oleg,Drinking water is zero. It means it’s pure.,2105,statement
Ashley,"I see. Zero means drinking water. So, eighty-five is definitely not for drinking.",2105,statement
Oleg,"Well, of course. That's what it's filtered for.",2105,statement
Ashley,"So if you clean it up to eighty-five, then there are 15% left to get drinking water.",2105,statement
Oleg,No. There are filters that will allow you to do this to zero.,2105,statement
Ashley,Mhm.,2105,backchannel
Oleg,"But at the same time, losses will be up to 60%. Since the maximum value of the filters.",2105,statement
Ashley,"So, at seventeen thirty-nine, you can only clean up to 85%.",2105,statement
Oleg,Yes.,2105,statement
Ashley,So it’s not the best point.,2105,statement
Oleg,Obviously it’s not. But technically it is possible.,2105,statement
Vika,No.,2105,statement
Will,May I have some fruits?,2105,question
Vika,Sure. Do we have some? Would you like nuts?,2105,question
Will,Is there no fruit?,2105,question
Vika,There are dried apples. There is a whole apple.,2105,statement
Vika,Do you want me to cut it?,2105,question
Will,"Twenty-five three. No, thanks. It’s fine.",2105,statement
Vika,And why eighteen thirty-nine... twenty-five three?,2105,question
Oleg,What about seventeen... It can be cleansed.,2105,statement
Vika,"No, I mean...Will...",2105,statement
Oleg,Is there any water?,2105,question
Vika,"Damn, why are we so stupid today?",2105,question
Will,Fifty fifty-three?,2105,question
Vika,Repeat once again. What was the last point you mentioned?,2105,question
Will,What do you mean?,2105,question
Vika,Twenty-five thirty-nine? Twenty-five three? Which one?,2105,question
Will,Hm? What? What you are trying to say?,2105,question
Vika,What was the last point you named?,2105,question
Will,I don’t know. Look it up in the chat. I posted a lot.,2105,statement
Oleg,They are looking at twenty-five three.,2105,statement
Will,Yes.,2105,statement
Salah,"I’m sorry, which one?",2105,question
Oleg,We have considered it before.,2105,statement
Salah,Twenty-five three? Who said it before?,2105,question
Ashley,I did...Why?,2105,statement
Salah,Because they are asking about it. [UI],2105,statement
Salah,[SL]Here. [UI],2105,statement
Will,Great.,2105,statement
Vika,Five thousand.,2105,statement
Ashley,"So, twenty-five three. Remind me, was that good for everyone here?",2105,question
Will,"It was alright. It’s not the best for me, but…",2105,disruption
Vika,Yeah. We can do that.,2105,statement
Will,Other people in the geology team can handle it. We can handle it.,2105,statement
Oleg,They are looking at us right now and like “Ahh! They eat!”,2105,statement
Will,"Like, “What the hell is wrong with that guy?”",2105,question
Will,"I’d love to see both teams on, like, a big screen with all six going.",2105,statement
Ashley,"Yeah. So, we can see where everyone’s looking; what are they thinking.",2105,statement

Vika,What about seventeen thirty-nine?,2105,question
Ashley,Eighteen thirty-nine?,2105,question

Salah,No more?,2105,question
Vika,Or twenty-five three.,2105,statement

Ashley,"My group seems to think it’s okay, and I like it too. What about you?",2105,question
Salah,"Yeah. I did the calculation and sent it to them. I’m waiting for their reply now. If they say “okay”, maybe we’ll agree on the point.",2105,statement
Ashley,Sounds good.,2105,statement
Oleg,Nineteen thirty-four?,2105,question

Vika,Mechanical engineer or…,2105,floor-grabber
Ashley,Materials.,2105,statement

Will,Seventeen thirty-nine — it’s true.,2105,statement
Salah,"Twenty-five three, yeah?",2105,question
Vika,Seventeen thirty-nine.,2105,statement
Ashley,"So, these are the two top runners basically. Seventeen thirty-nine and twenty-five three. It seems.",2105,statement
Oleg,Seventeen thirty-nine — yes.,2105,statement
Oleg,It’s not the best but still could work.,2105,statement
Salah,Did you check the last…//do you have the last page?,2105,question
Vik,//Damn it.,2105,statement
Salah,"Guys, do you have this page? Can you check?",2105,question
Oleg,Page number?,2105,question

Ashley,"//On the last... On the last page, there are //some good suggestions.",2105,statement

Vika,Yeah.,2105,backchannel
Salah,You see if this is good or not good.,2105,statement
Ashley,Yeah. That’s fine.,2105,statement
Vika,That's awful! Yikes! Who wants?,2105,question
Oleg,Ash?,2105,question
Ashley,No. [UI],2105,statement
Oleg,You will later say that you missed it again ... or you were cheated. And go to Lyosha to complain.,2105,statement
Vika,Who? Oops! Ohh it’s so pleasant.,2105,statement

Will,"I think, the structural geologist has to put…",2105,disruption
Oleg,Seventeen thirty-nine.,2105,statement
Salah,It’s not the best option…It’s good.,2105,statement
Ashley,Come on! We have to get all of us agreeing.,2105,statement
Salah,"Now you see, huh?",2105,question
Vika,What’s that?,2105,question
Will,Fuck.,2105,statement
Vika,What’s that?,2105,question
Salah,//When I’m putting…,2105,disruption
Ashley,Yeah.,2105,backchannel
Will,"//I wrote, and there was a glitch and that is what happened.",2105,statement
Salah,"//[UI]. The equipment cost per hour for this one is three hundred, so it’s high. //It’s a good option, it’s not the best.",2105,statement
Ashley,//Well let me what see my stuff here is. So what do I want to put in here?,2105,question
Ashley,"So, hygiene decision. So, seventeen //thirty-nine.",2105,statement
Oleg,//I can clean it up. So what? Do we agree with seventeen thirty-nine?,2105,question
Vika,It is clear to whom it all became even more interesting.,2105,statement
Ashley,"[SL] Okay, Twenty-seven, so…",2105,floor-grabber
Oleg,I want at least one positive.,2105,statement
Vika,"No, I want //to send letters already.",2105,statement

Oleg,Please check one twenty-eight.,2105,statement
Ashley,Which one?,2105,question
Vika,Is this your point or your friends?,2105,question
Oleg,"No, it's mine.",2105,statement
Ashley,Oleg!,2105,statement
Ashley,It's already time for us to connect.,2105,statement
Oleg,"So, well, that's it.",2105,statement
Ashley,And what do you want?,2105,question
Oleg,"I agree with seventeen thirty-nine. Yeah... but I suggest another one, one twenty-eight.",2105,statement
Ashley,One...One?,2105,question
Oleg,One twenty-eight.,2105,statement
Ashley,Twenty-eight.,2105,statement
Vika,// It’s fine. But I think that there will be not enough water.,2105,statement
Ashley,"Not bad, but the population to be able to live there is very small.",2105,statement
Vika,Very little water.,2105,statement
Ashley,Okay.,2105,statement
Oleg,"Well, that's all then. Seventeen thirty...",2105,statement
Ashley,That’s all!,2105,statement
Oleg,"Look here, Ash. Ash.",2105,statement
Ashley,I see.,2105,statement

Vika,Losses are decent.,2105,statement
Ashley,Sniper.,2105,statement
Oleg,Yes. You’re a sniper.,2105,statement
Ashley,"Okay. So, seventeen thirty-nine is…",2105,statement
Oleg,Well... Shall we choose this one?,2105,question
Ashley,"…one…distance of one. So, it’s one yellow zone. Distance less than a mile, so that’s okay.",2105,statement
Ashley,"[UI] affects usability…Low, put that as a three. Maintenance…[UI]. Ope, zero there…so…",2105,statement
Will,What are they waiting for?,2105,question
Ashley,"[UI]Four…hygiene, hygiene. Two.",2105,statement
Ashley,"It costs twice as much as allowed but that’s okay, because we’re going to have to pull that [UI]",2105,disruption
Oleg,How can the map be enlarged?,2105,question
Salah,Which point?,2105,question
Salah,"Which point are you talking about, guys?",2105,question
Ashley,"We are still talking…We are all just agreeing on seventeen thirty-nine and deciding on our values for what to put for our individual stuff. So, let’s see. If I put…",2105,statement
Oleg,One thirty is simply superb. Where the purest water goes.,2105,statement
Ashley,Red zone…,2105,floor-grabber
Vika,One thirty or one twenty-eight?,2105,question
Oleg,One thirty.,2105,statement
Oleg,There are really great places...,2105,statement
Salah,Seems that the guy who is working as a drilling specialist didn’t read the manual. He is just copying and sending answers.,2105,statement
Will,"Well, yeah, but I mean remember how it was when we first started doing it too.",2105,statement
Salah,Yeah.,2105,backchannel
Will,"If he is new, he has no clue what the hell he is doing.",2105,statement
Salah,Because I’m giving him some options of which is good quality.,2105,statement
Will,Mhm.,2105,backchannel
Salah,"He is telling me drilling method, which is the worst one.",2105,statement
Will,"Yeah. Well, I mean, you got used to working with Katya.",2105,statement
Salah,It’s so weird. He doesn’t understand.,2105,statement
Will,"But Katya was injured in a freak drilling accident. So now, she’s getting her arm repaired.",2105,statement
Salah,For humanity to Mars.,2105,statement
Will,Yeah.,2105,backchannel
Oleg,This one is generally gorgeous — two forty-five. I think everyone will like it.,2105,statement
Ashley,Oleg is still ... looking for? Looking for.,2105,question

Vika,//Two forty-five.,2105,statement

Oleg,Forty-five.,2105,statement
Ashley,Forty-five.,2105,statement
Vika,It’s fine basically.,2105,statement
Ashley,For me it’s fine too. Maybe even better.,2105,statement
Oleg,"Well, just, if on those, then we will lose sixty percent.",2105,statement
Will,"Damn! Now one of them is saying,",2105,statement
Will,“Nineteen thirty-four and twenty-five three are the best options”. But now I’m confused.,2105,statement
Ashley,"Oh, my people were saying that seventeen thirty-nine.",2105,statement
Will,"I know. One of them was, too. Maybe this is just a delayed message.",2105,statement
Ashley,"Maybe. Because ours said, “Seventeen thirty-nine is greater than -- twenty-five thirty is greater than nineteen thirty-four.”",2105,statement
Salah,"You know, it’s the chain. If I’m in here…if I’m agreeing on my team, they will send it to your team. And they will send it to theirs.",2105,statement
Vika,"Oleg, are you still looking?",2105,question
Oleg,No. I answer. I was given three options.,2105,statement
Will,"This means that they are discussing, and it is not clear to them what to choose. So, I now asked operations if they actually chose or not.",2105,statement
Vika,What?,2105,question
Ashley,"I think it’s delayed, because I sent them my decisions for training and then they, like, “What are your decisions?”. I’m, like, “I just sent them to you.” The delay! Although, six-minute delay is no comparison to our one-week delay for…",2105,statement
Will,Fuck!,2105,statement
Vika,"Yeah. So, did you receive some messages?",2105,question
Ashley,"I got something today, yeah.",2105,statement
Vika,"From past, or…",2105,floor-grabber
Ashley,"No. Actually, it was on time. I think they sent it this morning, so.",2105,statement
Vika,Okay.,2105,statement
Ashley,But still…I mean everybody else.,2105,statement
Vika,What’s up? What have you got?,2105,question
Oleg,Twenty-five thirty is too...,2105,statement
Vika,Thirty? Not three?,2105,question
Oleg,Three. Three.,2105,statement
Will,"Okay! Put the coordinates there, please! I want to continue.",2105,statement
Vika,"Will, wanna some nuts?",2105,question
Salah,Which point? They are discussing about seventeen thirty-nine.,2105,statement
Ashley,I think so.,2105,statement
Will,"Oh, wait. Hold up. Something…",2105,statement
Ashley,Uh-oh. What?,2105,question
Will,Fluid engineer is going nuts. //Fluid engineer started trying to…,2105,statement
Ashley,//Fluid engineer. What’s up with the engineering team? Come on!,2105,question
Will,What are they trying to do with my guy? Okay. Structural.,2105,question
Salah,It has been reset by it?,2105,question
Ashley,"Okay. //Oh, I didn’t even know that it was already…",2105,statement
Will,"//Yeah, because the fluid…fluid…No, no. Fluid boy started smashing the signoff button.",2105,statement
Ashley,Oh.,2105,statement
Will,Instead of…,2105,disruption
Oleg,"So, what are we going to choose?",2105,question
Will,//We're just waiting for them to put a point there.,2105,statement
Salah,//What should we actually do to be signing off?,2105,question
Ashley,I think that they have to decide on their side.,2105,statement
Oleg,I have the same percentage everywhere. I use maximum filters everywhere.,2105,statement
Will,"Then just sit and wait until... If you've already set your things, you've already set them. If not, then we wait.",2105,statement
Oleg,"The thing is that where it is clean, there is no water. Where there is water, it is muddy everywhere and this is the maximum filtration.",2105,statement
Oleg,There will be losses anyway.,2105,statement
Vika,Does everybody fill out already?,2105,question
Oleg,Are you filling out?,2105,question
Ashley,"They said that maintenance filters are A, D and H for stage one, two and three. If that means anything to you, guys. For me it does, so, A, D, H.",2105,statement
Oleg,No one has filled out for me yet.,2105,statement
Vika,"Five minute delay, right?",2105,question
Oleg,Three.,2105,statement
Ashley,Three to one side.,2105,statement
Oleg,They are at seventeen thirty-nine.,2105,statement
Vika,It seems to me that it can simply be called “struck”.,2105,statement
Will,Okay. We need to wait.,2105,statement
Vika,Nuts? You want?,2105,question
Ashley,One moment. I’ve got to get my stuff in.,2105,statement
Will,I guess it’s already in there.,2105,statement
Ashley,Yeah. It looks like my team entered the things for me. That I had mentioned in the chat.,2105,statement
Vika,That’s it? Have we chosen this point? That’s it. Great.,2105,question
Oleg,Which one? Which one?,2105,question
Will,Seventeen thirty-nine. Okay. We’re making good progress. Let’s get it. Let’s get it!,2105,statement
Salah,Which one?,2105,question
Will,We are ready to sign off. Did you get everything filled in? You ready to go to sign off?,2105,question
Vika,How did you do it?,2105,question
Will,What do you mean?,2105,question
Vika,How did you put that point?,2105,question
Will,Which one? It’s they who did.,2105,statement
Ashley,They did it.,2105,statement
Vika,"Oh, okay.",2105,statement
Salah,"So, we should fill it?",2105,question
Ashley,"Yeah, if you are ready to sign off.",2105,statement
Ashley,They probably filled it in based on the chat stuff.,2105,statement
Vika,"Oh, drilling specialist…specialist.",2105,statement
Ashley,Manuel Alger.,2105,statement
Vika,What?,2105,question
Ashley,"It says Manuel Alger but, like, I was trying to make it funny, like it’s a name.",2105,statement
Vika,Alright. Funny.,2105,statement
Ashley,It wasn’t funny at all.,2105,statement
Salah,"So, which point they chose?",2105,question
Ashley,Seventeen thirty-nine.,2105,statement
Vika,Sign.,2105,statement
Oleg,What?,2105,question
Vika,Sign.,2105,statement
Oleg,Now I will choose which filter is better.,2105,statement
Ashley,You can’t choose anymore. There is already.,2105,statement
Vika,It seems to be filled in automatically.,2105,statement
Oleg,Mhm.,2105,backchannel
Ashley,"They gave A, D, H.",2105,statement
Will,"Oleg, have you pressed yet?",2105,question

Vika,What? What?,2105,question

Salah,No.,2105,statement
Will,Looks like it’s…I think we’re good.,2105,statement
Salah,We are doing…,2105,floor-grabber

Igor,Select and you can press “next”.,2102,statement

Vika,"How to send messages, right? We are now learning how to send them.",2102,statement

Igor,Here’s a message. Has it arrived?,2102,question
Katya,Now I…,2102,disruption

Salah,"So, if I have the message, I",2102,statement

Igor,Only if it’s cool.,2102,statement
Will,Only if it’s not The Animals.,2102,statement

Igor,Only to one of your two contacts. Yes.,2102,statement
Oleg,"//[SL] Okay, alright.",2102,statement
Vika,Now I click on it and…how do I know whom to forward it to.,2102,statement
Oleg,You need to see about the overall workload and how many incoming messages they already have. That’s what I think.,2102,statement
Will,If there are already ten //we need to forward more so that it’s even more fun.,2102,statement
Igor,//Never mind. [UI],2102,statement

Katya,"So, I need to be on his team, right?",2102,question
Igor,"Okay, so. I apologize. I probably misspoke and I oversimplified the things a little bit. You need to know who is doing what in general. You don’t need to know the details. You know.",2102,statement
Salah,Yeah.,2102,statement
Igor,Not very [UI] but…,2102,disruption

Oleg,"And how do I understand that it is…so, it’s from the message itself that I understand that it is mine.",2102,statement

Igor,//the person to whom…,2102,floor-grabber

Will,//Cool.,2102,statement
Oleg,No. Different. Different.,2102,statement

Oleg,So here I can see those addressed to me?,2102,question
Igor,Destination – you.,2102,statement
Oleg,Well.,2102,disruption
Igor,That’s it. Session is over.,2102,statement
Will,Cool.,2102,statement
Igor,Okay. So…,2102,statement
Igor,"You might’ve learned something. Maybe you didn’t. Maybe, you understood something…",2102,floor-grabber
Oleg,"Well, overall, there’s this idea that…Oh. Again. Or we are supposed to agree in advance who communicates with whom and we all interact…in advance.",2102,statement
Will,I think…,2102,disruption
Vika,But why?,2102,question
Oleg,"But the thing is that, see, I already have messages that have circled around.",2102,statement
Oleg,"So, one person has already picked me, and I picked them. //And this person…",2102,statement
Vika,//But you can pick some other person.,2102,statement
Oleg,What?,2102,question
Vika,You simply choose a different person.,2102,statement
Will,Yes.,2102,statement
Oleg,No.,2102,statement
Katya,"Maybe, we should establish a system based on our roles? For example, choose so that I have two…I choose such that the specialist is bipolar,",2102,question
Igor,I…,2102,question
Katya,at least.,2102,statement
Igor,"I wanted to tell you that you can now sit here, because at first I kept my computer here. One person can now sit here. You are sitting so close together. You can now find different spots for sitting.",2102,statement
Oleg,Really?,2102,question
Igor,You can now.,2102,statement
Vika,I would like to sit on the floor.,2102,statement
Will,"Well…yes, yes. Okay.",2102,statement
Igor,You can change where you are sitting now.,2102,statement
Will,Okay. I will go sit in a different place.,2102,statement
Igor,"Well, no. We can just spread out a bit.",2102,statement
Will,Okay.,2102,statement
Katya,Is that necessary?,2102,question
Igor,"No, no. You don’t have to. //You just can.",2102,statement
Katya,I can stay in my place.,2102,statement
Igor,No. Two people on one side and two people on the other so that…,2102,floor-grabber
Vika,"A, okay.",2102,statement
Igor,So we are not too close together.,2102,statement
Will,Thank you…Now we can…,2102,floor-grabber
Ashley,"Oh. //Oh, sorry!",2102,statement
Igor,//I am doing a technique now. Right now. I will call you back [UI],2102,statement

Igor,"Yeah, so, you [SL] come forward.",2102,statement
Oleg,"Well, are there any other suggestions?",2102,question
Igor,We can talk.,2102,statement
Oleg,"I got the impression that I accidentally chose somebody that had chosen me. But it’s somebody that is not here. It is probably from somewhere in Chicago…//, and we practically to each other…",2102,statement
Igor,//I will say right away. We are pretty limited in terms of time today.,2102,statement
Igor,"Well, because we have people waiting there. So, you can talk about this quickly, but then we should start. You can then do something next time. Okay?",2102,question
Oleg,Yes.,2102,statement
Igor,It’s just that the time is not //limitless.,2102,statement
Vika,Are we choosing or are we agreeing?,2102,question
Oleg,Yes. We are choosing.,2102,statement
Ashley,Choosing.,2102,statement
Vika,Okay.,2102,statement
Katya,"We can’t decide and agree, right?",2102,question
Igor,"Well, you can. You can but…",2102,statement
Katya,"Perhaps, we should broaden it so that…",2102,floor-grabber
Will,Can we now?,2102,question
Igor,Yes.,2102,statement
Will,Great. Cool!,2102,statement
Oleg,That’s it. Next.,2102,statement
Oleg,So…,2102,disruption

Ashley,Oops.,2102,statement
Will,"Remember, if something is not clear, just send it on to somebody.",2102,statement
Vika,What?,2102,question
Will,"If you don’t know, just give it to somebody.",2102,statement
Vika,Yes.,2102,statement
Will,There is no need to sit on them. It’s not like that will help.,2102,statement
Salah,[SL] Sorry.,2102,statement
Ashley,Yeah.,2102,backchannel
Will,Cool.,2102,backchannel
Oleg,"Okay…Katyusha, where are you going?",2102,question
Katya,"Just a sec, just a sec.",2102,statement
Will,This is the time to actually do something cool.,2102,statement
Oleg,The thing here is to give it to someone that can receive and process it as quickly as possible. But not to the person that sent it to you.,2102,statement
Vika,"Well, not necessarily. Maybe, you will send it back. Of course, you will exchange messages for a while, but then the one that sent it to you will send it on to somebody else.",2102,statement
Oleg,"But if that person sent it to you, it means that he or she looked and nothing…",2102,floor-grabber
Will,"But, maybe, that person did it quickly. Perhaps, they did not think about it.",2102,statement
Will,"Perhaps, he or she //thought it was for you, but maybe another person on their team can send it to someone else. We don’t know. Just think about it and give it to someone. The quicker the better.",2102,statement
Vika,"//Yes, yes…I agree.",2102,statement
Oleg,"//Okay, so…",2102,statement
Oleg,"Well, //I have two crew members that were",2102,disruption

Oleg,"Oh, so…",2102,statement
Will,Good evening.,2102,statement
Oleg,"Where? Last time, it was all very dynamic. I don’t write so many messages in one day.",2102,statement
Katya,"Oleg, it’s just that this time we are not the popular ones",2102,question
Oleg,"Yes. I chose somebody wrong, so that I…",2102,disruption
Katya,//Wow! I have an assignment…,2102,statement
Salah,"//So, I know now who was messaging me before.",2102,statement
Ashley,"//I was pushing a lot last time, too.",2102,statement

Salah,[SL]Now you’re pushing it too.,2102,statement
Katya,Yeah?,2102,question
Oleg,"Next, next, next, next.",2102,statement
Oleg,This is again just instructions. Complete the assignments too. Okay. Next. …And…I have a feeling that they are playing their own game there in Chicago.,2102,statement
Vika,I want to play in your sandbox.,2102,statement
Oleg,Yes. So now what? Oh!,2102,question
Oleg,Where?!,2102,question
Ashley,Still nothing?,2102,question
Oleg,"Let’s not write! Ourselves then? …Oh, we have happier people here.",2102,statement
Will,"Cool, cool, cool. Cool, cool, cool.",2102,statement
Vika,Hm. Rather [UI],2102,statement

Salah,"Hm…Now I got it! …So, Igor! If this message contained me,",2102,statement
Salah,"I have to make it like this, right? Destination – me. Right?",2102,question
Ashley,You mean the final message. I think you’re fine. It would just…,2102,statement
Igor,No. Those would be the messages that you receive.,2102,statement
Salah,"Yeah, but this is the…this is me. This is my job. Yeah, where should I keep it?",2102,question
Igor,"No, it should.",2102,statement
Salah,"Okay, will…",2102,floor-grabber
Igor,Is that you?,2102,question
Salah,Yeah. That’s my job.,2102,statement
Ashley,You’re maintenance costs? Upkeeping maintenance?,2102,question
Salah,Maintenance and robots. Cost of robots and rovers.,2102,statement
Ashley,I thought you were materials specialist.,2102,statement
Igor,Were you…,2102,floor-grabber
Salah,"Yeah, this is me.",2102,statement
Ashley,Okay. Because I would think that that would fall more under maintenance specialist and not materials specialist.,2102,statement
Salah,"No, it is one of my main things.",2102,statement
Ashley,"One of, but maybe you’re not the best person to be final.",2102,statement
Igor,"You are materials specialist, right?",2102,question
Salah,Yeah.,2102,backchannel
Katya,But we’re in one group with Abdulla.,2102,statement
Salah,"Yeah, yeah.",2102,statement
Katya,It’s our job to use the cheapest robotics.,2102,statement
Igor,These should be your individual goals. Not your team goals.,2102,statement
Oleg,No. Something is not right here.,2102,statement
Oleg,"We had the last one, it’s just…",2102,floor-grabber
Ashley,"Perhaps, they say something there.",2102,statement
Oleg,//very many letters. Now there are none.,2102,statement
Salah,Okay.,2102,statement
Oleg,Are we sure everything is working right?,2102,question
Will,//We have everything working right.,2102,statement
Oleg,Time is slipping away.,2102,statement
Ashley,This one has gone through a lot of people.,2102,statement
Oleg,I have a feeling that they are sending messages to each other there.,2102,statement
Will,"Well, we…",2102,floor-grabber
Will,"I have many, //those that already…",2102,disruption
Oleg,"Oh, okay. //[UI]",2102,statement
Igor,You can minimize overall the rover’s cost. Here…,2102,statement
Igor,But there is no maintenance.,2102,statement
Will,Damn.,2102,statement
Oleg,Oops!,2102,statement
Salah,"Okay, [UI]",2102,disruption
Igor,This is labor. Some others need their stuff. Cost of drilling a hole.,2102,statement

Katya,But here in the end…,2102,floor-grabber

Oleg,"So, this is [UI]. [UI]",2102,statement

Oleg,You are not…,2102,floor-grabber
Katya,I am trying to choose so as not to repeat it.,2102,statement
Oleg,"Well, what you have can’t be repeated anyway. Give it to anyone. This one is reading now, and you give it to that other one. Let him figure out whom to send it to.",2102,statement
Oleg,"Oh, there. It is, then [UI]",2102,statement
Oleg,I have a feeling that everyone has now selected somebody wrong.,2102,statement

Oleg,"//Yes, this one is just introductory.",2102,statement
