15989,Will," And loss at recharge. So, also the recharge loss and that depends on, again, loss related to [SL] promitability here. So, you’ll see that come up. And intrasource flow loss or loss of low in the source. So, the water going in between the two, which…",1,1,0,statement
15990,Will," you’ll see that as CA or UCA. Okay. Well, what is this…",1,1,0,statement

16037,Oleg, We need to determine from what ground and from what location we will take it.,1,1,0,statement
16038,Oleg," in order to further determine the power of the pump, //that will be suitable.",1,1,0,statement
16039,Will," Okay, so, I take it the first one is the ground? Yes. //Through which...",1,1,4,question

16057,Will, Okay. Good.,1,1,0,statement
16058,Oleg," And, it is very important, so as not to re-read here, it is very important that the water is less contaminated with small things.
