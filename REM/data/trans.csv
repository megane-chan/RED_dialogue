349,Natash,Yes… [UI],1,1903
350,Dash,"Anyway, what’s here? Nothing?",1,1903
351,Natash,Your numbers don’t increase my output somehow. Only my numbers increase my output.,1,1903
352,Dash,"Yes, yes, yes.",1,1903
353,Rya,Pumps work…,1,1903
354,Natash,"Yes. Torque… So, here we also have [UI] since they also placed checkmarks, entering more won’t work.",1,1903

360,Ali,"So, they didn’t answer you, right Nastya? Your question… Very good.",1,1903
361,Nasty,They’re probably afraid [UI],1,1903
362,Dash,[UI],1,1903
363,Ali,Nastya said they are scared to answer.,1,1903
364,Dash,[SL] Why do we need these Chicagoans?,1,1903

369,Ali,Can Chicago hear anything?,1,1903
370,Dash,So why didn’t [SL] Zarya log on? We already logged on.,1,1903
371,Nasty,//I do but hydrogeologist [SL] is not answering.,1,1903
372,Rya,Maybe they are not even on.,1,1903
373,Ali,"No, they are on. They answered.",1,1903
374,Rya,"//Oh, they did? Ok.",1,1903

379,Dash,It’s like having soap in your mouth.,1,1903
380,Nasty,//There is soap in the walnut.,1,1903
381,Zheny,//Walnuts with soap are also delicious.,1,1903
382,Dash,What kind again?,1,1903
383,Zheny,They just washed it but forgot to rinse.,1,1903
384,Nasty,[UI],1,1903
385,Dash,"Ah, I get it now. Yes.",1,1903
386,Ali,"She ate a walnut. She said it tasted like soap in her mouth. And she is like: “Yeah. It’s just a soap in your walnut” [UI]. //It’s fine, right? Like that.",1,1903
387,Rya,[UI],1,1903
388,Zheny,No worries.,1,1903
389,Ali,Like that…,1,1903

398,Dash,"And, anyway, that’s why… none of them never did anything in the past.",1,1903
399,Nasty,I think they just didn’t turn it on.//Our office is also relaxing now.,1,1903

430,Alik to Nasty,//But can you see me?,1,1903
431,Nastya to Ali,Are you doing something now?,1,1903
432,Ali,"I wrote, yes.",1,1903
433,Nasty,Just a sec. I’m answering…,1,1903
434,Zheny,I tried so hard. “Hello” I wrote.,1,1903

465,Zheny,Yes… I feel like he eats well. Very good.,1,1903
466,Nasty,Will they translate us? All these conversations?,1,1903
467,Zheny,And what? We’re not saying anything wrong. Max is great.,1,1903
468,Nasty,"Oh, Max answered “I think so.” That’s what he said.",1,1903
469,Zheny,Did he answer you from last time?,1,1903

491,Nastya to Rya,He called Dasha Soapy Walnut. It’s a new nickname.,1,1903
492,Zheny,I didn’t get it right away. She says: “I ate soap.” And I said: “How did you eat soap?” A walnut like soap.,1,1903
493,Nasty,You are [UI] and she is soapy walnut.,1,1903
494,Rya,[UI],1,1903
495,Nasty,We need four more.,1,1903
496,Zheny,"Well, how about this – Kimberly…//So, what area we doing?...// [UI] not answering, right?",1,1903
497,Ali,//I don’t like all this for some reason. What the hell?,1,1903

499,Ali,"No, no need for that. They’ll get more offended. //Then they won’t talk to us at all.",1,1903
500,Nasty,//What about us? Aren’t we offended?,1,1903
501,Zheny,Can we make a decision ourselves here or do we //need to wait?,1,1903

544,Dash,"It will be like Morse Code, right?",1,1903

588,Nasty,They got old.,1,1903

614,Zheny,I feel like they’re lying for some reason.,1,1903
615,Natash,If none of them move their program ends there. They told us to finish everything in forty-five minutes.,1,1903

617,Zheny,They’re sleeping.,1,1903
618,Natash,There really is no one there.,1,1903

625,Zheny,What?,1,1903
626,Natash,"Well, like, they stayed in the program so it would send some know-nothing message in the chat every ten minutes.",1,1903
627,Dash,"Yes, definitely, because…",1,1903
628,Natash,Because: “They send this message. We have twenty minutes” …//Is meaningless.,1,1903
629,Ali,//Yes. They’re checking something.,1,1903
630,Natash,Just as if…,1,1903
631,Nasty,"Ah there, I received one from you.",1,1903
632,Ali,You received one? Good.,1,1903

671,Rya,You can’t expect them to be reading all of them anyways.,1,1903
672,Ali,"Yeah, that’s… anything //[UI]",1,1903
673,Nasty,"Wait, I also… What I wrote to you loaded in general chat on mine for some reason.",1,1903

686,Zheny,Yes… I’m terrain,1,1903
687,Natash,[UI] they don’t choose very well… I don’t know… all my work with the Martian groups.,1,1903
688,Zheny,You’re hard on them…,1,1903
689,Natash,"Not as hard as I could be yet, but now I’m choosing “somewhat [UI]” //instead of “nice [UI]”",1,1903
690,Dash,"//Can we check with our [UI] about what role the Martian group plays besides placing checkmarks? Well, if robots are answering us, in our version, since it’s not always…",1,1903

692,Dash,"Well, we’re just talking about some of our data, and the person there writes about twenty minutes.",1,1903
693,Ali,"Well, today was an unusual session…",1,1903
694,Natash,All the other times //were like that.,1,1903
695,Dash,"//Well, last time too, when the delays started, there wasn’t a single decent, appropriate answer. I mean, at first they praised us: “Yes, together is cool. Good job for choosing her…” There weren’t delays then. The messages were live…",1,1903
696,Ali,"Well, we can ask. [To Ryan] She wants to [UI] if it’s actually people responding to us and they do not use a computer program. [UI] since delay has been implemented, the system really [UI] the communications.",1,1903
697,Rya,Yeah. [UI] people. But I don’t know.,1,1903
698,Zheny,Does this actually bother someone?,1,1903
699,Dash,"No. Well, it’s just that we have to sit like this for another twenty minutes…",1,1903
700,Zheny,"Well, [UI].",1,1903
701,Dash,And?,1,1903
702,Zheny,[UI] anybody.,1,1903
703,Dash,We’ll finish all this and break up…,1,1903
704,Zheny,They will sit there…,1,1903
705,Dash,On purpose?,1,1903
706,Zheny,Send a photo… //[UI],1,1903

710,Rya,Everybody [UI],1,1903
711,Ali,Yeah. Let everybody [UI].,1,1903
712,Natash,And why did geology ask that question [UI] ?,1,1903
713,Dash,Yes.,1,1903
714,Natash,In two parts.,1,1903
715,Dash,More parts.,1,1903

722,Rya,[UI],1,1903
723,Ali,The [SL] PLC for this.,1,1903
724,Rya,It must be here. One of Igor’s…,1,1903
725,Ali,Igor?,1,1903
726,Rya,"Yeah, I think. //Just email him.",1,1903
727,Ali,"//If it really bothers you, you can ask Igor [SL] Saveliev. But I doubt even he knows about this. [UI] knows more.",1,1903
728,Rya,You would just send it to [UI].,1,1903
729,Alik to Dash,Wait until May eleventh and then ask your questions.,1,1903
730,Zheny,Write them down in a notebook and then ask when he arrives.,1,1903
731,Ali,//It will be like that.,1,1903
732,Rya,"Igor mentioned that the chat would be [UI] delayed. So, I think last time we had [SL] their local [UI].",1,1903
733,Alik to Dash,"See, he says Igor said then that as soon as the delay takes effect, this chat will basically be useless. So, then we will work independently from them, and they will be independent from us. And at the end we will place checkmarks and finish and that’s it. Like today. So, waiting for them is pointless.",1,1903
734,Rya,A little different… This went different today.,1,1903
735,Natash,"So, we need to do more probably… Don’t place checkmarks in the first ten minutes, but after fifteen or twenty minutes //so that later [UI]",1,1903
736,Ali,"We managed in seven or eight minutes, right?",1,1903
737,Natash,"Well, sure. We can sit and chat. Just don’t place checkmarks.",1,1903

743,Ali,The very last one – Project Red Training [UI].,1,1903

895,Video," Project Red has two tasks. The first task [UI]. The second task is to [UI] within the task force. We have identified eight different regions [SL] online where water used to be, and you can see in what order.",0,1902
896,Video, You will investigate each of the locations [UI] Project Red [UI] project. [UI] the development of the water infrastructure leading to establish [UI] on Mars.,0,1902
897,Video, The critical discovery of underground water resource will be our direct project goal. [UI] to explore the possibility of [UI] clean water to the [UI]. As you can imagine [UI] water resource [UI] and fresh clean water is critical to the [UI],0,1902
898,Video," Your Project Red task force will have to pick members of your series group as well as the members of question analysis group. Due to the complexity associated with [UI] on Mars various areas of expertise are represented across the task force. For example, in your astronaut group you will discover an expert in one of the following areas. Planetary geology, engineering, space robotics, [UI]",0,1902
899,Video," Back on Earth the remaining members of the task force are also experts in these four areas. This way the twelve number Project Red task force will utilize [UI] across four areas of expertise to accomplish three overall task force objectives. Your task force has three objectives: First -water yield. This is the amount of water that will be available for [SL] each of your colleagues. Ideally, each human will receive twenty gallons of water per day.",0,1902
900,Video," Second- water quality. This is the percentage of water that is contaminated [UI]. Contaminated water is unusable. The contaminants can be removed through the filters. Third is usability. This is a measure of how accessible the water is to [UI]. [UI] the number of people who can access the water. The well should provide the sustainable amount of water to [UI]. However, excess water will be considered waste.",0,1902
901,Video," In order to accomplish these three objectives the task force will need to consider a variety of factors including the water yield in various locations, the amount of contaminants in the water in the particular area along with [UI] contaminants, the accessibility of the region to future human populations and the [UI]. One important thing to keep in mind is that disciplinary team [UI] task force. [UI] set of the factors.",0,1902
902,Video, Individual team objectives are likely to [UI]. [UI] utility information about your specific area of expertise and the tools you use to achieve your objective. We are [UI] on the serious task force to work together to achieve your objectives. This mission is a critical first step towards establishing [UI] Earth-independent colony on the Red planet.

926,Alik, So this is the Mars group. Mars analysts. We haven’t talked with them for two weeks now. They did something that had an outcome. So… Today we have forty-five minutes to reach an agreement and sign about the new approximate place where we want to work. So… How is this different from last time?,0,1902
927,Alik, This time we’ll have a five-minute pause…//So they will [UI],0,1902

935,Natasha, Are they already going to be entered somewhere? Or should we just take paper from here //and write them down?,0,1902
936,Alik," We can just find these ones, eighteen coma fifty, find them somewhere and see what our data is… that’s it. So, we already have a place. We already did that.",0,1902
937,Natasha, Where are we going?,0,1902

1606,Nastya:,  Why?,1,1902
1607,Natasha, Twelve nineteen… [UI],1,1902
1608,Ryan, [UI],1,1902
1609,Alik, What?,1,1902
1610,Dasha," Look, biomechanical is here, but she doesn’t respond. She is doing something. She chose one filter, another filter. //But why won’t she respond?",1,1902
1611,Natasha, //But I only have one filter.,1,1902
1612,Dasha," No, well I think that’s… about her activity.",1,1902
1613,Alik, What’s going on? Write to her.,1,1902
1614,Zhenya, Outrageous!,1,1902
1615,Alik, Don’t be rude. Just ask her.,1,1902
1616,Dasha," I didn’t plan to be rude to her… So, what are you saying?",1,1902
1617,Alik, Can you please reply me the answer.,1,1902
1618,Natasha, Here is my data.,1,1902
1619,Dasha to Alik, How do you write “reply”?,1,1902

1632,Nastya," Yeah, no one has eaten ice cream. Get that out.",1,1902
1633,Dasha," Yeah, I forgot about it.",1,1902
1634,Nastya, I thought you… didn’t like it.,1,1902
1635,Dasha," No, I like it. //I just didn’t want to eat it yesterday before training.",1,1902
1636,Nastya, When I ate it my throat started to swell…,1,1902
1637,Ryan to Zhenya, //[UI],1,1902
1638,Dasha, //[UI],1,1902
1639,Alik, So there are fifteen minutes left.,1,1902
1640,Zhenya, Thank God.,1,1902
1641,Dasha, We don’t have to do all this. We can place our checkmarks and that’s it.,1,1902
1642,Alik," Well, when is time there…",1,1902
1643,Zhenya, I was completely ready by the fifth minute already.,1,1902
1644,Alik, To place a checkmark?,1,1902
1645,Zhenya," Yes. Basically, what’s up",1,1902
1646,Natasha, I have such an important job. I need to fill out four graphs.,1,1902
1647,Dasha," Mhm, poor thing… But why did it… I only just saw the message, but then I asked her again?",1,1902
1648,Alik," Well, it’s five minutes, remember? There and five minutes back. So, ten minutes.",1,1902
1649,Natasha, Where did you see that?,1,1902
1650,Dasha, She wrote me in private chat.,1,1902
1651,Natasha, And what is she writing?,1,1902
1652,Dasha, It was sent twenty-five minutes in.,1,1902
1653,Natasha, What does it mean?,1,1902
1654,Dasha, Alik.,1,1902

1659,Natasha, Lunch.,1,1902
1660,Zhenya, Breakfast.,1,1902
1661,Alik," She wrote on minute twenty-five. That makes sense. So, we have to wait another ten minutes for her to answer if she answers immediately. But that’s no guarantee.",1,1902
1662,Dasha," So, and now ask what we are doing the first twenty-five minutes.",1,1902
1663,Nastya , We still have everything…,1,1902
1664,Alik, We’re cooking nuts.,1,1902
1665,Zhenya, //Eating ice cream.,1,1902
1666,Nastya," //Still negative, dang.",1,1902
1667,Zhenya, What?,1,1902
1668,Nastya," That’s a price, right? Performance minus sixty-two thousand.",1,1902
1669,Alik," No, it’s not a money price, I don’t think.",1,1902
1670,Ryan, //[UI],1,1902
1671,Alik," So, it’s the inefficiency of our system. In the minus, a huge minus.",1,1902
1672,Natasha, //I don’t know what to do now.,1,1902
1673,Alik, //But it’s expensive.,1,1902
1674,Dasha," But it will be so [SL] smooth, right?",1,1902
1675,Nastya, I already picked all these high parameters for [UI].,1,1902

1684,Nastya," Well, that’s a lot.",1,1902
1685,Alik, Yes.,1,1902
1686,Zhenya, Yes.,1,1902
1687,Dasha, But what are we waiting for?,1,1902
1688,Nastya, Five minutes.,1,1902
1689,Dasha," Responses, right?... Her message went away again.",1,1902
1690,Zhenya, Didn’t make it.,1,1902
1691,Dasha," No, the one I read. I read it aloud.",1,1902
1692,Zhenya, //Casually…,1,1902
1693,Alik, And after this everyone will fill out D Church eight and then we’ll watch another //video.,1,1902
1694,Nastya, //[UI],1,1902
1695,Dasha, I may be hallucinating… But that message didn’t get there… Although…,1,1902
1696,Natasha, //Maybe I took too little. I need more.,1,1902
1697,Nastya, What?,1,1902
1698,Dasha," I wrote the reply to our biomechanic that you said. Then she answered. It turns out, her message that I read five minutes later became her message again. Then her message disappeared and now that message appeared with this hydrogeologist.",1,1902
1699,Natasha," Yes, I’m also confused now/",1,1902
1700,Ryan and Zhenya, //[UI],1,1902
1701,Nastya, I’m not getting an answer.,1,1902

1707,Alik," Yes, with a delay:it’s difficult.",1,1902
1708,Ryan to Zhenya, The second one you already have [UI].,1,1902
1709,Zhenya, Pipe?,1,1902
1710,Ryan, Yes.,1,1902
1711,Zhenya, Sixty.,1,1902
1712,Natasha, Is this because you chose cast iron? Is that why no one is answering us?,1,1902
1713,Ryan to Zhenya, Decisions.,1,1902
1714,Zhenya, Decisions.,1,1902
1715,Ryan to Zhenya," Here, and again down here.",1,1902
1716,Zhenya, And here?,1,1902
1717,Natasha, Maybe I need to increase the wattage?,1,1902
1718,Alik to Natasha, Where else? There is two hundred fifty thousand?,1,1902
1719,Natasha, Yes. That enough? Don’t need it? And the torque? I have sixty-five thousand.,1,1902
1720,Nastya, //[UI],1,1902
1721,Natasha," //I almost… I didn’t extend it all the way, but…",1,1902

1723,Natasha," Ninety-nine thousand, and there I think is five hundred thousand.",1,1902
1724,Nastya," Have you tried, are they there?",1,1902
1725,Natasha," There is more there, yes, of course… //But it’s useless…",1,1902
1726,Ryan to Alik, //[UI],1,1902

1729,Nastya," Here, take half of mine.",1,1902
1730,Natasha," Oh, no, no thanks, Dasha.",1,1902
1731,Nastya to Dasha, Eat this. I’m not… What?,1,1902
1732,Dasha, [UI],1,1902
1733,Ryan, What is “Kusai”?,1,1902

1741,Nastya, Kusat.,1,1902
1742,Ryan, Ok.,1,1902
1743,Nastya, Like “kushat” is “eat”. “Kusat” yeah…,1,1902
1744,Ryan," Yeah, that’s why I was confused… Kushat, kusat…",1,1902
1745,Natash,"So, okay. Why did mechanical engineer only give one filter?",1,1902
1746,Dash,Mhm.,1,1902
1747,Natash,Why?,1,1902
1748,Dash,Last time also //there was only filter.,1,1902
1749,Natash,"//Oy, there were some [UI]… How are you?:are you writing that? Yeah? She isn’t even answering //what you’re writing…",1,1902
1750,Nasty,//And she can’t write to me.,1,1902
1751,Dasha, And who is this?,1,1902
1752,Nasty,//Operation specialist.,1,1902

1754,Natash,"They are displayed, but it’s some kind of nonsense…",1,1902
1755,Dash,Yes.,1,1902
1756,Natash,"//Anyway, some of the messages still haven’t gone anywhere.",1,1902
1757,Ali,//And they will get their [SL] Max role. I don’t see what you’re writing to him. Why?,1,1902
1758,Dash,"Because she is writing in the chat and not to him, probably, right?",1,1902
1759,Natash,"Yes… Oh, Look, Ryan, look my remote // is piercing me.",1,1902
1760,Nasty,//He bailed hard.,1,1902

1772,Natash,[laughter] Set her off…,1,1902
1773,Nasty,Do they check the chats later?,1,1902
1774,Ali,They check all this.,1,1902
1775,Dash,Are you writing something vulgar over there?,1,1902
1776,Natash,Then write it in chat.,1,1902
1777,Nasty,Who?,1,1902
1778,Natash,You.,1,1902
1779,Ali,And who else?,1,1902

1783,Rya,//I did. From hydrogeologist. Zhenya is monitoring Martian terrain:OK.,1,1902
1784,Zheny,Ryan for two…,1,1902

1798,Ali,Has system written that we need to place checkmarks yet?,1,1902
1799,Natash,No.,1,1902
1800,Zheny,I feel like it’s time. What’s the delay?,1,1902
1801,Ali,She wrote one time and people placed checkmarks. And then it didn’t work.,1,1902
1802,Natash,Then I did //[UI],1,1902
1803,Ali,//[UI],1,1902

1806,Nasty,//Yes.,1,1902
1807,Dash,"I see that the hydrogeologist sent that to me. I’m like: Oh, dude, moment!! And then it turns out to be you, probably. [To Ryan] What are you saying?",1,1902
1808,Rya,Where?,1,1902
1809,Dash,//[UI],1,1902
1810,Natash,//[UI],1,1902

3233,Ali,"Ah, yes, yes. She has an accent.",1,1904
3234,Dash,Done? We log out?,1,1904
3235,Nasty,"Oh, okay…",1,1904
3236,Stefani,Did they not enter them or is the mechanical engineer still entering other filters? No?,1,1904
3237,Dash,"Well, it’s always the same filter…",1,1904
3238,Stefani,"Ah, it doesn’t say that here… Of course, I’m always entering plastic, but…",1,1904
3239,Dash,Today I’m also //[UI],1,1904
3240,Zheny,"Oh, hydrogeologist… I don’t know, did he write to everyone?",1,1904
3241,Ali,Yes.,1,1904
3242,Nasty,Why did she…,1,1904
3243,Stefani,Forty-five more minutes?,1,1904
3244,Zheny,Forty-five more minutes…,1,1904
3245,Ali,Thirty-nine minutes.,1,1904
3246,Zheny,And who is hydrogeologist?,1,1904
3247,Dash,Theirs.,1,1904
3248,Ali,No.,1,1904
3249,Nasty,Yes.,1,1904
3250,Ali,We have drilling.,1,1904
3251,Zheny,//Thirty-five? And they wrote forty-five to me?,1,1904
3252,Nasty,"//No, she means on that side.",1,1904
3253,Dash,That is…,1,1904
3254,Nasty,Not on our team.,1,1904
3255,Ali,"Ah. Well,  they wrote me: “Thirty-nine minutes.”",1,1904
3256,Zheny,Why are they different? …I have forty-five for some reason.,1,1904
3257,Stefani,"Maybe that’s the second time they’re writing, and we only read the first one… They want us to fight.",1,1904
3258,Ali,Yes. [UI],1,1904
3259,Dash,Yes.,1,1904
3260,Zheny,Clever plan.,1,1904
3261,Dash,"I’m logging out, right?",1,1904
3262,Stefani,"No, well, you need to wait at least, probably, how many minutes?.. How long will we be doing this task? Fifteen minutes? And then log off?",1,1904
3263,Ali,We’re basically all ready. //We can place checkmarks.,1,1904
3264,Stefani,"//Well just so it’s not so fast, in just two minutes…",1,1904
3265,Dash,"Well, what if we’re just that good? We have nine thousand people!",1,1904
3266,Ali,It’s already been ten minutes. //Because the questionnaire appears every ten minutes.,1,1904
3267,Stefani,//[UI],1,1904
3268,Nasty,"Ok, then “Sign off,” right?",1,1904
3269,Stefani,"Ah, so, we sign off and we still have to fill out these questionnaires for forty-five minutes. Like last time.",1,1904
3270,Nasty,Maybe not.,1,1904
3271,Ali,"No, why not? We need to do all of it. So, //this task. Then there are two D Church. Then there is … Ah, no, there is D Church, then we send letters, then another D Church… and then another two D Churches.",1,1904
3272,Stefani,"//Well, last time…",1,1904
3273,Dash,[UI],1,1904
3274,Stefani,"That is one, that is two.",1,1904
3275,Zheny,[UI],1,1904
3276,Nasty,"Anyway, I will “Sign off” …right?",1,1904
3277,Ali,"Ah, I see, that… Yes, me too…",1,1904
3278,Nasty,//Enough already.,1,1904
3279,Zheny,//Now what?,1,1904
3280,Ali,Place checkmarks.,1,1904
3281,Dash,Is there a second one?,1,1904
3282,Stefani,"No, I remember last time we sat… And then we…",1,1904
3283,Nasty,"Ah, because they didn’t “Sign off” there. They just stopped… Apparently, they totally overslept then or something… … They didn’t enter anything, remember that?..",1,1904
3284,Stefani,"Yes. And now we have all their data, right?",1,1904
3285,Ali,Yes.,1,1904
3286,Dash,If they ruin our record… Nine thousand…,1,1904
3287,Nasty,Biochemical engineer…,1,1904
3288,Stefani,"Nothing. Nothing, but he didn’t do one thing.",1,1904
3289,Dash,He doesn’t have to choose. //We only have one filter.,1,1904
3290,Stefani,Yes.,1,1904
3291,Nasty,Yes.,1,1904
3292,Dash,"Ryan, please give me some apple. A piece… Thanks.",1,1904
3293,Ryan to Ali,//[UI],1,1904
3294,Stefani,//Remember how Aphrodite made the gods fight around the table?,1,1904
3295,Nasty,"Yes, I remember something like that.",1,1904
3296,Stefani,"She sent them an apple and said this apple is for the most beautiful and the cleverest. But she didn’t say who… So, a war began.",1,1904
3297,Dash,Who didn’t log out? Mechanical engineer.,1,1904
3298,Stefani,"I signed out, but they kicked me for some reason.",1,1904
3299,Stefani,Yes.,1,1904
3300,Nasty,You have everything.,1,1904
3301,Ali,"That’s it. Now it’s up to them. So, all six of us did it… Their call.",1,1904
3302,Stefani,"Well, they’ll start writing something now.",1,1904
3303,Nasty,Wait for it to get to them…,1,1904
3304,Stefani,Yeah.,1,1904
3305,Dash,Did anyone write to us?,1,1904
3306,Nasty,"No, no fun messages at all.",1,1904
3307,Dash,They are sent out all in a row. That’s no fun at all.,1,1904
3308,Nasty,What’s up? Did he write something to you?,1,1904
3309,Ali,"He wrote: “Hi. Yes, I am.” But what does that mean?",1,1904
3310,Nasty,What?,1,1904
3311,Ali,Or was he answering a question?,1,1904
3312,Dash,Why are they writing something to you but not us?,1,1904
3313,Ali,"Well, here everything is scattered out of time…",1,1904
3314,Nasty,"“Hi. Yes, I am” – what’s that?",1,1904
3315,Ali,"Ah, see, “Hi. Yes, I am” appears here. I mean, here that makes sense.",1,1904
3316,Nasty,"Ah, yes.",1,1904
3317,Ali,"I asked him: “Are you ready to work?” He says: “Yes, I am.”",1,1904
3318,Dash,You ask: “Are you ready to finish working?”,1,1904
3319,Ali,"That’s what I should have done, right?",1,1904
3320,Nasty,"Why don’t I write: “We are done.”… No, then what?",1,1904
3321,Ali,"Well, basically, yes. We already made our decisions. So write: “Can you please mark off?”",1,1904
3322,Stefani,"//And I can write that, right?",1,1904
3323,Nasty,//Mark off or Sign off?,1,1904
3324,Ali,//Sign off…Ah?,1,1904
3325,Stefani,"But can we, yes that, sort of, in the dialog?",1,1904
3326,Ali,"Well, we’re communicating with them. Everything goes by the rules. They can say that they are ready or not ready. It’s up to them now.",1,1904
3327,Dash,They’re sitting there yelling: “No way! Give me plastic!”,1,1904
3328,Ali,"They are standing by the blackboard drawing equations. Equation drawing, brainstorming.",1,1904
3329,Dash,“How do those Russians do it?!”,1,1904
3330,Rya,They are all: “[SL] How can this be?!”,1,1904
3331,Ali,“What’s wrong with these people?!”,1,1904
3332,Dash,[UI],1,1904
3333,Zheny,They are wiping their glasses and [UI],1,1904
3334,Nasty,And we’re eating here!,1,1904
3335,Stefani,Eating and neighing. [These words rhyme in Russian],1,1904
3336,Zheny,We already ate all the apples.,1,1904
3337,Dash,Oy. I can hear you better like that.,1,1904
3338,Nasty,No way! Surprising!,1,1904
3339,Dash,I’m an engineer… My ears are sweating.,1,1904
3340,Nasty,So many pluses.,1,1904
3341,Ali,That’s good… Is that a smile?,1,1904
3342,Nasty,Yes.,1,1904
3343,Ali,There is something missing.,1,1904
3344,Nasty,It’s like an abbreviated smile.,1,1904
3345,Dash,A smiley.,1,1904
3346,Nasty,"Or do you want cool, and then dash and…",1,1904
3347,Dash,"Oy, those [UI] … Smells like two thousand three, probably.",1,1904
3348,Nasty,What?,1,1904
3349,Dash,"//Well, when, remember [UI]?",1,1904
3350,Nasty,//Did you smell the headphones?,1,1904
3351,Dash,//No…,1,1904
3352,Ali,"I also thought the headphones. These are yours, I guess.",1,1904
3353,Zheny,"No, that’s right.",1,1904
3354,Dash,"No, that’s not why. Just colon, dash and parenthesis.",1,1904
3355,Stefani,"Oh, that took forever for me to understand. I remember, my friend showed me letters that her other friend wrote her from Russia. They were quite advanced and already used smiley faces.",1,1904
3356,Ali,And you are still in the dark.,1,1904
3357,Stefani,What is this? What’s with the sticks? Brackets. How? Where? I don’t understand.,1,1904
3358,Nasty,"I studied this language for so long when [UI] from New Zealand. They shorten every English word and, apparently, use the number four instead of the word “for.”",1,1904
3359,Stefani,"Ah, yes, yes, yes.",1,1904
3360,Nasty,"And with this. And at first, I received messages and went crazy trying to figure them out: “This here is this, this is this, and this is this.” //It’s a whole separate language.",1,1904
3361,Ali,There is the letter “B” and the number “four.”,1,1904
3362,Stefani,And just “U”…,1,1904
3363,Nasty,"Yes, yes, yes. “Before” is “before,” “before.” And they write ”B” and four.",1,1904
3364,Ali,Talking about the certain languages in text messages. When early on people were [UI] some language.,1,1904
3365,Zheny,And what did they write there? Now thirty-one minutes.,1,1904
3366,Dash,Are they writing you the time again?,1,1904
3367,Zheny,"Well, “Hi, ending…” What did they write there?",1,1904
3368,Rya,They are saying to us that we have thirty-one minutes left.,1,1904
3369,Ali,"Ah, well this…",1,1904
3370,Nasty,"Ah, we also have a clock.",1,1904
3371,Zheny,Theirs is hanging right over them.,1,1904
3372,Nasty,I said that we also have a clock here.,1,1904
3373,Ali,They probably think we have nothing here.,1,1904
3374,Zheny,We have lots of clocks. We can [UI] send them one.,1,1904
3375,Ali,What now?,1,1904
3376,Dash,But why aren’t they writing anything to us?,1,1904
3377,Stefani,Mhm.,1,1904
3378,Zheny,They’re ignoring us.,1,1904
3379,Dash,"They write everything to everyone, but not to us. Only the geologist writes to us.",1,1904
3380,Stefani,He wrote just one time.,1,1904
3381,Dash,The first time. Twice.,1,1904
3382,Zheny,Your team is so unfriendly.,1,1904
3383,Ali,"Oh, it’s been twenty minutes.",1,1904
3384,Zheny,Well.,1,1904
3385,Stefani,"It won’t go. I’m telling you, we’ll have to sit this out.",1,1904
3386,Dash,Ineffective program.,1,1904
3387,Stefani,Mhm.,1,1904
3388,Dash,Not under our command.,1,1904
3389,Stefani,Certainly.,1,1904
3390,Dash,We should already be digging.,1,1904
3391,Stefani,I don’t know. I could have brewed tea by now.,1,1904
3392,Nasty,"Hey, what the heck? My finger was punctured. And [UI] right into the hole.",1,1904
3393,Stefani,Did they give you something for it?,1,1904
3394,Nasty,No.,1,1904
3395,Stefani,Don’t forgot to see Zhenya for procedures.,1,1904
3396,Nasty,Yes.,1,1904
3397,Zheny,I have a clinic.,1,1904
3398,Stefani,Zhenya has a trauma clinic.,1,1904
3399,Ali,//[UI],1,1904
3400,Nasty,//A sticker…,1,1904
3401,Rya,They offer that.,1,1904
3402,Ali,Yeah. [UI],1,1904
3403,Stefani,"Will you take it with you, Zhenya?",1,1904
3404,Dash,"Why are they only looking at me and Ryan? Look, there are four other people here.",1,1904
3405,Nasty,So what?,1,1904
3406,Stefani,Let it be like this [UI],1,1904
3407,Ali,She is asking why are the cameras looking at you two only and not the other four people.,1,1904
3408,Nasty,It’s a compliment. We don’t look very good.,1,1904
3409,Zheny,Of course.,1,1904
3410,Ali,"It’s a compliment. You are attractive people, you know.",1,1904
3411,Nasty,"What, doesn’t work like that? Dang, I like… made a nice move there.",1,1904
3412,Zheny,And no one is sniffing the headphones now. Cause they’re like // “What’s with the headphones over there?”,1,1904
3413,Nasty,//[UI],1,1904
3414,Stefani,See? I’m not the only one who noticed. [UI],1,1904
3415,Nasty,"Although, should have done it for Alik too. He can also do it…",1,1904
3416,Ali,I don’t do that…,1,1904
3417,Zheny,"No, Alik is good at covering himself with paper, like…Hop.",1,1904
3418,Ali,I read the instructions.,1,1904
3419,Zheny,This bro put your badge in my cabin today.,1,1904
3420,Ali,Did they get mixed up?,1,1904
3421,Zheny,With these… Yes.,1,1904
3422,Nasty,With the fringe.,1,1904
3423,Zheny,//With a fringe.,1,1904
3424,Ali,//[UI],1,1904
3425,Stefani,//How could he confuse that?,1,1904
3426,Rya,Sorry.,1,1904
3427,Ali,You gave hers to the… [UI],1,1904
3428,Zheny,I just noticed in time.,1,1904
3429,Nasty,He thinks you need more colors.,1,1904
3430,Stefani,You need a bit of style.,1,1904
3431,Zheny,Gray…,1,1904
3432,Ali,"You thought he was in the bad mood. That’s why you gave him that one, right?",1,1904
3433,Rya,Just to cheer him up.,1,1904
3434,Ali,Just to lift his mood.,1,1904
3435,Nasty,"Dasha, aren’t you hot?",1,1904
3436,Dash,I remember one Bomfunk MC song when he is… What’s it called?,1,1904
3437,Nasty,Freestyler.,1,1904
3438,Dash,"Yes, that’s it. I feel it.",1,1904
3439,Nasty,And I immediately remember Shnur [Russian pop star] who dances to this song. [UI].,1,1904
3440,Dash,I turned it on.,1,1904
3441,Rya,Off.,1,1904

3443,Nasty,"That’s why they’re watching you, Dasha.",1,1904
3444,Zheny,Of course.,1,1904
3445,Dash,"I turned it on. You’ll see later, when you throw it over, if I was lying or not.",1,1904
3446,Rya,[UI],1,1904
3447,Nasty,What?,1,1904
3448,Rya,"No, it’s recording now.",1,1904
3449,Ali,"Yes, I know, but something happened.",1,1904
3450,Stefani,"He, probably, [UI]",1,1904
3451,Nasty,He is throwing himself now.,1,1904
3452,Stefani,Word by word: “Throw. You. //Now.”,1,1904
3453,Nasty,//You. They are throwing us.,1,1904
3454,Rya,I don’t know which [UI]. Now you…,1,1904
3455,Nasty,"Well, basically, you said: “I will throw you //with all…”",1,1904
3456,Stefani,//Away.,1,1904
3457,Ali,It sounds very funny.,1,1904
3458,Nasty,I will throw you off now. //Like from the train.,1,1904
3459,Rya,//Right.,1,1904
3460,Stefani,//In Russian it…,1,1904
3461,Zheny,//But it’s easier to say: “Ah-ta-ta!” Like that.,1,1904
3462,Stefani,Scold with your finger like this.,1,1904
3463,Zheny,Ah-ta-ta!,1,1904
3464,Stefani,"No, don’t do that!",1,1904
3465,Ali,//They are recording all this right now!,1,1904

3471,Stefani,"No, please. It’s too much. No more “Ah-ta-ta!”",1,1904
3472,Dash,"I’m not opposed, Ryan.",1,1904
3473,Rya,[UI],1,1904
3474,Dash,You don’t have to do it that way.,1,1904
3475,Nasty,You can say : “I’ll throw you off.”,1,1904
3476,Rya,I’m not saying anything.,1,1904
3477,Ali,"Yeah, don’t be trapped. Nastya is the [UI] one.",1,1904
3478,Nasty,"Tell me which one. The worst, right?",1,1904
3479,Ali,"No, not the worst.",1,1904
3480,Nasty,"The worst devil  here, no? I have such cool adjectives.",1,1904
3481,Dash,"Can you find out from Igor, so Igor finds out from [UI] why we’re sitting here? It’s just that we could spend our time more effectively.",1,1904
3482,Nasty,Yes.,1,1904

3484,Dash,//[UI],1,1904
3485,Ali,//I’ll report all the problems to Igor.,1,1904

3487,Ali,Huh?,1,1904
3488,Stefani,Maybe there are some surveys there…,1,1904
3489,Nasty,Maybe.,1,1904
3490,Stefani,Maybe…ah…,1,1904
3491,Nasty,"Come on. Fill it out, fill it out.",1,1904
3492,Stefani,I’ll be back soon. Just a sec. One minute.,1,1904
3493,Ali,"Ok. Go ahead, go ahead.",1,1904
3494,Dash,No one can see you.,1,1904
3495,Ali,Now she can do whatever she wants to there.,1,1904
3496,Nasty,Let’s discuss some things a bit.,1,1904
3497,Dash,[UI] and record everything on the voice recorder.,1,1904
3498,Nasty,What is wrong.,1,1904
3499,Zheny,"Yes, it still doesn’t matter. Sitting.",1,1904
3500,Nasty,Where will you wear the sensors from SonoTouch that we should have?,1,1904
3501,Stefani,"Just stick them anywhere that’s free. How many sensors is it? One, two, three…",1,1904
3502,Nasty,Five.,1,1904

3504,Nasty,"Oh, even more.",1,1904
3505,Stefani,Five.,1,1904
3506,Zheny,"Well, this attaches on the left, right?",1,1904
3507,Stefani,"One does, yes. These ones //they go here and…",1,1904
3508,Zheny,//They can go here somewhere. On the other side.,1,1904
3509,Nasty,But why do we need them at all? What if we don’t attach them? Why do we need them? Can we not connect them?,1,1904
3510,Zheny,They need to be there.,1,1904
3511,Stefani,"You need to connect them because if you don’t, // the device won’t work.",1,1904
3512,Dash,//What about on the back?,1,1904
3513,Stefani,"Put them wherever you want to. They have to reach, that’s the main thing.",1,1904
3514,Dash,"Well, just put them back – and that’s it.",1,1904
3515,Stefani,We need them. I’m telling you…//Zhenya’s idea works.,1,1904
3516,Dash,I can draw a smiley face for you. //As if…,1,1904
3517,Nasty,"On my back, yes…",1,1904
3518,Stefani,You just don’t want them to be in the way when you put on your pack…,1,1904
3519,Zheny,"No, the pack is comfortable. I will put one on this side and one on the other.",1,1904
3520,Stefani,//You can put them all really close together…,1,1904
3521,Ali,//[UI]. So they don’t interfere with your backpack //when you put them.,1,1904
3522,Zheny,"//They should probably be on the chest, //because the pack is there.",1,1904
3523,Ali,//[UI],1,1904
3524,Stefani,//We will practice.,1,1904
3525,Ali,//Because right now //[UI],1,1904
3526,Stefani,"//Here on your breast will be a large sensor with four electrodes, //which we will stick right here.",1,1904
3527,Alik to Rya,//[UI],1,1904
3528,Zheny,"//So, and those electrodes go on the other side.",1,1904
3529,Nasty,"//Or, you know, like how you attach a collar.",1,1904
3530,Alik to Rya,//[UI],1,1904
3531,Zheny,"//No, most likely one here and the second already here.",1,1904
3532,Nasty,Can we put it on our belly?,1,1904
3533,Zheny,That’s not very comfortable for me.,1,1904

3535,Rya,//I don’t know what [UI],1,1904
3536,Nasty,"Ah, you have [SL] hair there…",1,1904
3537,Zheny,No. Stick it on this side. Just like that and that’s it.,1,1904
3538,Rya,If turns on?,1,1904
3539,Ali,He’s asking: “But how do you know if it’s turned on and works even?”,1,1904
3540,Zheny,What?,1,1904
3541,Ali,This device.,1,1904
3542,Dash,You can see it.,1,1904
3543,Zheny,Which one?,1,1904
3544,Nasty,SonoTouch. It is saying. [SL] You can see that.,1,1904
3545,Rya,So we are just looking?,1,1904
3546,Stefani,[UI].  Whatever you turn on you also set up for us.,1,1904
3547,Rya,Ok.,1,1904
3548,Dash,Why did he only just become interested in finding out when it works?,1,1904
3549,Stefani,He turned it on for us for two months.,1,1904
3550,Nasty,"No, he thought, not that.",1,1904
3551,Ali,"Yes, yes, yes.",1,1904
3552,Nasty,"You thought it’s a different one, right?",1,1904
3553,Zheny,"No, that’s the one.",1,1904
3554,Ali,Again.,1,1904
3555,Rya,I just want to make sure we know that it’s working.,1,1904
3556,Nasty,Yeah.,1,1904
3557,Ali,Yeah.,1,1904
3558,Zheny,Is this next to last for us already?,1,1904
3559,Ali,That means thirty minutes has passed.,1,1904
3560,Zheny,Thank God.,1,1904
3561,Nasty,"It’s… They say you need to connect anyway, because if you stick it out it’s not gonna work. So, you just put those sensors wherever you want.",1,1904
3562,Stefani,Only sensor… Head sensor.,1,1904
3563,Dash,At first I liked Project Red. I thought it would be hard to calculate or do anything here.,1,1904
3564,Stefani,"Well, yes, it doesn’t really give information or feedback.",1,1904
3565,Dash,We’re shooting on the same goal. [soccer-related expression],1,1904
3566,Stefani,I also thought it would be more interesting.,1,1904
3567,Zheny,I understood from the beginning.,1,1904
3568,Dash,We should have gone with Zhenya.,1,1904
3569,Zheny,Why didn’t you ask?,1,1904
3570,Stefani,"I mean, it was difficult, but I thought it would get more complex and would become more interesting when we started doing something.",1,1904
3571,Ali,"They thought it was gonna get more complicated with each session, it’s gonna be more interesting and challenging but it seems like we are doing the same thing.",1,1904
3572,Rya,It’s not interesting.,1,1904
3573,Ali,[UI],1,1904
3574,Rya,"It was harder [UI]. Maybe it’s different this time. So far, it’s been [SL] pretty easy… Looks like someone checked off.",1,1904
3575,Ali,They also placed a checkmark.,1,1904
3576,Dash,Whoa! Come on! There will be more now.,1,1904
3577,Ali,"Come on, come on, come on.",1,1904
3578,Dash,A hundred bucks says biomechanical does this all last.,1,1904
3579,Nasty,What are we betting?,1,1904
3580,Dash,I don’t know.,1,1904
3581,Zheny,"And I think sedimentologist will. Sedimentologist, I mean.",1,1904
3582,Ali,Sedimentologist will sign off next.,1,1904
3583,Rya,[SL] We got most figured out.,1,1904
3584,Dash,Dang. I lost.,1,1904

3596,Zheny,"Yes, I think so, with pens and pencils.",1,1904
3597,Ali,They are fighting.,1,1904
3598,Nasty,I don’t think I should keep doing this experiment…,1,1904
3599,Zheny,"Yes, it’s all over there.",1,1904
3600,Ali,They stopped caring…,1,1904
3601,Zheny,Max is already crying.,1,1904
3602,Nasty,Maybe this isn’t my path.,1,1904
3603,Ali,[UI],1,1904
3604,Rya,Hydrogeologist.,1,1904
3605,Zheny,"Yes, hydrogeologist. Who is that there? Maximka?",1,1904
3606,Nasty,No… Maximka is structural.,1,1904
3607,Zheny,That’s also fine. Not bad like that. Good.,1,1904
3608,Nasty,Maximka – know who it is? Maximka.,1,1904
3609,Rya,Maximka. Who is that?,1,1904
3610,Nasty,“Maximka” – it’s a name for Maxwell.,1,1904
3611,Rya,[UI],1,1904
3612,Ali,[UI] for Maxwell. [UI]…Done.,1,1904
3613,Zheny,"Done, is it over? So what, did we finish everything?",1,1904
3614,Ali,"Well, yes. Now [SL] I’m restarting my laptop.",1,1904
3615,Zheny,We won.,1,1904
3616,Ali,"Ah, a letter came… “Final [UI]…” Ah, they are saying: “Our team is making its final decision and will sign all this very soon.”",1,1904
3617,Zheny,That’s what I’m saying. They are finishing up right now.,1,1904
3618,Ali,"That’s hydrogeologist, right?",1,1904
3619,Nasty,"Done, close?",1,1904
3620,Ali,"Ok, now we need D Church. D Church eight. Eight, please.",1,1904
3621,Zheny,D Church.,1,1904
3622,Dash,//[UI],1,1904

3624,Zheny,"//That’s it, closing.",1,1904
3625,Dash,[UI]if they can’t enter when we are placing checkmarks.,1,1904

3796,Zheny,For some reason I’m hungry already.,2,1904
3797,Stefani,I know why that camera is directed at you… Because that camera is pointed at us.,2,1904

3827,Stefani,And the programs – is that a separate computer or…,2,1904
3828,Nasty,"It’s a separate computer with the programs. And you need to throw the data on a flash afterwards, when the time comes. When you’re already logging out of the…",2,1904
3829,Stefani,And leave them on the comp. They will mostly likely request them every day.,2,1904
3830,Nasty,"Ah, there? You need to throw all the data on a flash and [SL] unload them in the next program.",2,1904
3831,Stefani,"Yes, but that’s at the end, most likely, they will request specific data. At the end of each day. //Most likely like that.",2,1904
3832,Nasty,"//I don’t know. I usually threw everything on a flash, [SL] uploaded it and that’s it.",2,1904

3834,Nasty,Yes. They are big. I don’t remember…,2,1904
3835,Stefani,"Well, if they are big you can erase… instead of saving on a flash drive after. They are calling it “Very prompt medical control.”",2,1904

5983,Natasha, After this assignment we go to the Volcano? //Or after this assignment we do something else?,2,1901
5984,Alik," No, now we do [PH] D Church nine, and then we can stretch and go to the Volcano.",2,1901
5985,//Nastya, Yes.,2,1901
5986,//Zhenya, And then…,2,1901
5987,//Dasha," And for each of us… but, every Sunday is like this?",2,1901
5988,//Alik to Ryan, Every Sunday?,2,1901
5989,//Ryan," No, we only [UI] like five times.",2,1901
5990,Natasha," Do you remember how that went: “Oh volcano, my little volcano?”",2,1901
5991,Alik to Dasha, Only five times total.,2,1901
5992,//Dasha to Alik," Why, there were eight…",2,1901
5993,//Ryan, Actually…,2,1901

6003,//Ryan," Two, three four, five, six…",2,1901
6004,//Alik, We’ll find out right now. But it’s definitely not every weekend.,2,1901
6005,//Ryan, Yeah. Eight times.,2,1901
6006,//Dasha, Eight times.,2,1901
6007,//Natasha," Alik, how did the Volcano get involved in…",2,1901
6008,Alik, In this?,2,1901
6009,//Natasha, Yes.,2,1901
6010,Ryan, Eight. Eight times.,2,1901
6011,Alik to Natasha, Ask Ryan that. I don’t know.,2,1901
6012,Natasha to Ryan," Ryan, how did the Volcano get incorporated in your methodology?",2,1901
6013,Alik, [translating to Ryan],2,1901
6014,Ryan, The point is to transition immediately.,2,1901
6015,Ryan, You don’t have to translate.,2,1901
6016,Zhenya, Deal.,2,1901
6017,Alik, The most important thing is to go straight to the Volcano after this assignment. They want to see our reaction to the Volcano.,2,1901
6018,Ryan," And then, and then understand how you handle the transition.",2,1901
6019,Natasha," Ah, cool!",2,1901
6020,Alik," Take you, for example. This all made you so angry that you’ll be worse there on the Volcano, right? They’ll compare that to the morning Volcano.",2,1901
6021,Nastya, On the little Volcano.,2,1901
6022,Natasha," I understand, but the Volcano is for emergencies.",2,1901
6023,Alik," I know, but they somehow connected it with [UI]",2,1901
6024,Nastya, [UI],2,1901
6025,Ryan," They just needed any, any experiment. It doesn’t matter. But the point is…",2,1901
6026,Alik," Ah [sic], any experiment? Ah, no no. It could have been any experiment. As long as the Volcano was next. They were just interested in how you would do on the next experiment.",2,1901
6027,Nastya, But how do they find out the results?,2,1901
6028,Ryan, They’ll see in the questionnaire. They’ll ask questions about how…,2,1901
6029,Alik, Yes. There will a questionnaire that will decide everything.,2,1901
6030,Dasha, The questionnaire shall decide everything!,2,1901
6031,Alik, Absolutely. Just like soy sauce [laughter],2,1901
6032,Natasha," Well, I get it, I get it. They don’t really care what methodology is used there. //Just… [laughter]",2,1901
6033,//Alik," Yes, yes, yes. So, they aren’t going after your methodology. Don’t worry.",2,1901
6034,Nastya, So surprising [laughter],2,1901
6035,Nastya to Zhenya, You have two shirts. Me too.,2,1901
6036,Zhenya," Nooo, it’s…",2,1901
6037,Nastya, Not that comfortable…,2,1901
6038,Nastya," An ad, an ad… We’ll do it now…",2,1901
6039,Zhenya, Two right away?,2,1901
6040,Nastya, Mhm.,2,1901
6041,Zhenya, Even on underwear.,2,1901
6042,Nastya, The underwear don’t have…,2,1901
6043,Zhenya, Mine do. I tore it from here and stuck it on… with tape…,2,1901
6044,Natasha, [UI],2,1901
6045,Zhenya, Two minutes left. And Volcano.,2,1901
6046,Alik, First [PH] D Church.,2,1901
6047,Zhenya," Ah, we still have D “chort”… [the Russian word for “devil,” which sounds like “church”)",2,1901
6048,Alik," Yes… [PH] D Church, and then already…",2,1901
6049,Nastya," So, should we leave these… recorders //when we leave?",2,1901
6050,//Alik," No, after D “chort” we can turn them… After [PH] D Church we can turn them off. [laughter]",2,1901
6051,Natasha, And how do you say “chort” in English?,2,1901
6052,Alik, Devil.,2,1901
6053,Ryan," Ah, I get it.",2,1901
6054,Alik, Devil.,2,1901
6055,Natasha," We add a little letter, and then we add another little letter [singing] Tram tra tra. And I think one more. And we send this… And that’s how we do it.",2,1901
6056,Zhenya," And we have a minute, twenty seconds left.",2,1901
6057,Nastya, [SL] Natasha sends it [UI] Don’t give anymore.,2,1901
6058,Natasha, Did it work? Is it okay?,2,1901
6059,Dasha," Why is it telling me I don’t have any “Targets,” even though I sent it right to the Materials specialist several times.",2,1901
6060,Zhenya, It means you missed the mark. You’re just not hitting it. It happens. You didn’t aim well.,2,1901
6061,Natasha," No, “Targets” are when... let’s say Ryan clearly sends it to you.",2,1901
6062,Dasha," Doesn’t Ryan get it then, no?",2,1901
6063,Natasha, You do.,2,1901
6064,Dasha, Really?,2,1901
6065,Zhenya, Forty seconds.,2,1901
6066,//Natasha, Meteorologist is for Ryan. This letter is for Ryan.,2,1901
6067,//Dasha, What is this? Ryan didn’t send me a letter?,2,1901
6068,Alik to Ryan, Did you send her any letters?,2,1901
6069,Natasha," No, we need…",2,1901
6070,//Ryan, Often.,2,1901

6079,//Alik, That’s impossible.,2,1901
6080,Dasha," Here, here, look!",2,1901
6081,//Ryan, [UI],2,1901
6082,Alik, She has nothing in the records.,2,1901
6083,Natasha, And there is the airplane. I think that’s when you send it right.,2,1901
6084,Dasha," No, it’s just a message.",2,1901
6085,Alik, [UI],2,1901
6086,Dasha to Ryan, Do you have all these? Ah. And I have zero! Zero!,2,1901
6087,Zhenya, That’s it!,2,1901
6088,Alik," Okay, next…",2,1901

6095,Zhenya," So, [PH] D Church nine is nine, right?",2,1901
6096,Alik, Yes. Nine.,2,1901
6097,Zhenya, And we didn’t just do nine?,2,1901
6098,Alik, We did eight.,2,1901

6108,Zhenya, Komsomol.,2,1901
6109,Alik, Ahh.,2,1901
6110,Alik, Should I read you all the questions or do you get it?,2,1901
6111,Dasha, Yes.,2,1901
6112,Zhenya," Well, yes, because… Essentially, of course I can…",2,1901
6113,Alik, [reading the questionnaire] “Do you know who is connected with whom in this project?”,2,1901
6114,Dasha, Out of the six of us or the twelve of us?,2,1901
6115,Alik," No, in total in the whole project. [PH] Project Track. So, I know everyone. Who is with whom. Then [reading the questionnaire]: “I was able to forward the correct messages very quickly throughout this project and I have a solid understanding of how everyone is connected.”",2,1901
6116,Dasha," But how are we supposed to know the Chicagoans, for example? Fine, we’ll…",2,1901
6117,Alik," Well, we know how we are connected.",2,1901
6118,Dasha, Yes.,2,1901
6119,Alik, We discussed it here.,2,1901
6120,Dasha, What about the Chicagoans? That’s totally…,2,1901
6121,Alik," Well, we don’t know. So, say that. I don’t know. There is a choice here, actually. And the last one, the fourth [reading the questionnaire]: “I essentially revealed who was connected with whom and how on my own during this project.” Okay, next… Shall we read the next one?",2,1901
6122,Nastya, Mhm.,2,1901
6123,Alik," So. Now we answer about your small team. Your disciplinary. So, about your three… several… Okay. But it’s the very same question. So [reading the questionnaire]: “I know who is connected with whom on this small team. I forwarded letters quickly. I understand well who is connected with whom. And… I figured out who is connected with whom and how on my own.”",2,1901
6124,Alik," Next… Same questions, but about [H] Red Force. Fill it out.",2,1901
6125,Zhenya, But this is wrong here…,2,1901

6135,Alik, Are you there already? Just a sec…,2,1901
6136,Zhenya, You still aren’t there?,2,1901
6137,Alik," Ah, okay now I’m there. Good, so…",2,1901
6138,Nastya, The sedimentologist didn’t have to choose me. I chose him but he chose…,2,1901
6139,Alik," So, who was this sedimentologist connected with? Who were his two people?",2,1901
6140,Dasha, Should we pick two?,2,1901
6141,Natasha," So, this. Ah…",2,1901
6142,Alik," No, you can pick four people, two of which were his. It’s up to you. If you know…",2,1901
6143,Nastya," No, look… I chose him, but he didn’t choose me.",2,1901
6144,Natasha," Yes, this we apparently choose while// we guess who they were writing to.",2,1901
6145,Zhenya," We need to drag, right?",2,1901
6146,Alik, Huh?,2,1901

6157,Alik, You can remove it if you made a mistake.,2,1901
6158,Zhenya," I need to put myself here, right?",2,1901
6159,Alik," Well, it says here: “Whom did the sedimentologist choose?”",2,1901
6160,Zhenya," So, I think he chose me.",2,1901
6161,Natasha, Whom did the sedimentologist write to first?,2,1901
6162,Alik, No more than four people in the window.,2,1901
6163,Natasha, Did you remember?,2,1901
6164,Alik," Well, he is definitely in Chicago, right? The sedimentologist.",2,1901
6165,Natasha, Mhm.,2,1901
6166,Nastya," Oh, I don’t know. I guessed…",2,1901

6169,Alik to Ryan," Any idea, Ryan?",2,1901
6170,Ryan, For the other people – no.,2,1901
6171,Alik, Yeah. It’s kinda tough.,2,1901
6172,//Ryan, We’re gonna have to look it…,2,1901
6173,Zhenya," Two is enough, right?",2,1901
6174,Alik," You can even do four. If you guess two out of four, it will still be right.",2,1901
6175,Ryan, [UI],2,1901
6176,Dasha, And who had maintenance specialist?,2,1901
6177,Alik, Huh?,2,1901
6178,Dasha, Maintenance specialist.,2,1901
6179,Natasha, … I wrote to him.,2,1901
6180,Alik," Yes… What were you saying, Ryan?",2,1901
6181,Ryan," That would be difficult to do without looking at… or we could do it ourselves, obviously. But…",2,1901
6182,//Alik, Uh huh.,2,1901
6183,Natasha," Well, we need to anticipate. You understand, right? Whom they chose.",2,1901
6184,Alik," Ah, structural geologist. That’s the person I wrote to.",2,1901
6185,Ryan, How do you say in Russian: “Who did you have?”,2,1901

6196,Ryan," Hydro, hydro…",2,1901
6197,Dasha, Hydro… What if you guess it?,2,1901
6198,Alik, It’s possible… It’s better of course to try four and something will come out of them.,2,1901

2780,Katya, Don’t even check. It still doesn’t work for anyone.,2,2103
2781,Ashley," Well, you...you chose “thirty-two fifteen” first, right?",2,2103
2782,Oleg, Yes.,2,2103
2783,Katya, But they didn’t like it. The people on the ground didn’t like it.,2,2103
2784,Ashley, On the ground?,2,2103

11949,Will," But it’s, like, just a bit. …what do you mean, you can’t even filter this water?",0,2106
11950,Oleg, Because it is very muddy and polluted water with small particles ... mineral.,0,2106

11955,Will, Nineteen twenty-eight? Let’s take a look.,0,2106

11984,Salah, Yeah.,0,2106
11985,Will, Okay. They are logging in from different locations. Interesting.,0,2106
11986,Ashley, Yeah. Last time they mentioned that.,0,2106
11987,Salah, Did they mention this?,0,2106
11988,Ashley, To him they mentioned it. Who is actually responding to you?,0,2106
11989,Will, Structural geologist.,0,2106

11993,Ashley, It’s not bad. Yeah.,0,2106
11994,Salah, For me it’s okay.,0,2106
11995,Ashley," So, we have three options.",0,2106
11996,Salah, This is the best one.,0,2106
11997,Will," Yeah. Nineteen twenty-nine. Well, this ... this means that we are losing 60%. This means that we will have at the end ... This is not clear. If we lose it from the very beginning... I don’t know. It seems... it seems to work fine. Forty thousand or something...",0,2106
11998,Salah, What’s the loss of water?,0,2106
11999,Will, 66%. But there is like three hundred thousand there.,0,2106

12001,Will, Okay.,0,2106
12002,Salah, [SL] seven twenty.,0,2106
12003,Will," Well, I mean... Simply put, I want to know if it’s completely... not at all?",0,2106
12004,Oleg, No. The losses will be at the maximum.,0,2106
12005,Will, Maximum.,0,2106
12006,Oleg, 60%.,0,2106
12007,Will," Yes, yes, yes.",0,2106
12008,Oleg," So, that means",0,2106
12009,Will, Okay.,0,2106
12010,Oleg," the filtering system allows for filtering, but in this case it is too contaminated with small ones.",0,2106
12011,Will," Well, because there’s a lot of water there. So if it was another point where there is less water, I would say, like…",0,2106
12012,Vika, Less water.,0,2106
12013,Will, Hm?,0,2106
12014,Vika, You’d say: “Less water”,0,2106
12015,Oleg, No.,0,2106
12016,Will, No. //Then I would say that there is no reason to waste time on this. And if there is so much water...,0,2106
12017,Vika, //Or you would say that there is no water.,0,2106

12019,Will, But it’s in the third place already. This is already far from the other ones that we have.,0,2106
12020,Oleg," But if you look at the remaining forty percent, will that allow you to provide the population with water?",0,2106
12021,Will," Well, yes. It looks like it will work with some water. There are so many... there are three thousand... There we lose... two-thirds. So there is a hundred thousand left. And 60%... forty thousand is somehow, somewhere in a normal place. I mean, it’s not much, but it’s... It’s the same if we have another one, where we have a different level of loss or something.",0,2106
12022,Will," [SL] Okay. …Operations is still [UI]. Okay, cool. They are currently saying…I said…They said that both…",0,2106
12023,Oleg, So then? Shall we pick this one?,0,2106
12024,Will," They said seven eleven and ten thirty weren’t the best places to build anything, but I told them that, like, “I understand, but seven eleven and ten thirty are our",0,2106

12041,Vika, Why no water?,0,2106
12042,Oleg," Well, the mechanical says that for some reason.",0,2106

15629,Maybe Katya," Yes, I have already written to my material specialist.",0,2101
15630,Oleg, But before that he wrote that it was thirty-one twenty-six.,0,2101
15631,Alex," Perhaps, he has some information as to the volume of water and // the pressure, and he believes that there [UI]",0,2101

15644,Oleg," So, then, if you write //[UI]",0,2101
15645,Woman1, //Eleven ten. Something like that. Chicago is one hour…its ten.,0,2101
15646,Ryan, //[UI] you are trying to find even your own to figure out what the best location is and //to communicate with the other team,0,2101

15648,Ryan, // to see if that location works for them. Some locations don’t,0,2101
15649,Oleg," //This should work for you, right?",0,2101
15650,Alex, //Yes.,0,2101
15651,Salah," Yeah, but the thing is, like, // as I’m telling the material specialist…but that is, like, where are they going to choose this point? Who depends on that location at my point? The thing is, they…I don’t [UI]. At least the commander, who will say to choose that one or that one.",0,2101
15652,Alex," //Look here, I will show you [Ui]",0,2101
15653,Oleg," //Yes, here it is. It’s right here. See, it is a large one here? Large ones are much easier to evaluate, but at the same time //here…but we do not need filtration here. If [UI] is large, less of it remains under pressure.",0,2101
15654,Ashley," //Umm, okay. The things I want to look at:  no dust, not any type of volcanoes in microclimate.",0,2101

15666,Oleg," Oh, thirty-five forty.",0,2101

15682,Salah," So, I am the material specialist. So, guys, we have to choose first the location. So…",0,2101
15683,Vika, Which one?,0,2101
15684,Salah, To be considered about what type exactly I can choose for the drilling methods,0,2101
15685,Salah," and we will see the depth. Moreover, it will be more for the time drill, so these things we have to consider about. This my…our main object. And, for example, the availability of that water.",0,2101
15686,Ashley, Okay.,0,2101
15687,Oleg," This is all clear, but initially we need to decide on the location, and there is a proposal to use the location,",0,2101
15688,Oleg," that is on the plain. Considering that the parameters that, for example, have now been found with the coordinates thirty-five forty. They have a great depth, but only large [UI]…contaminants. That is, large rocks. It is easier to filter them out and there will be less resistance.",0,2101
15689,Salah, Mhm.,0,2101
15690,Oleg," There is a minimum of other contaminants. Consequently, we need a pump only to raise this water. That’s it. And if we look at those locations that are on the slope, there is a very large amount of mineral contaminants and small contaminants. And that will entail",0,2101
15691,Oleg, a great number of filters,0,2101
15692,Salah, Yes. Yes.,0,2101
15693,Oleg," And, consequently, it will increase the power of the pumps. We don’t need it. And, most importantly, our robots will not be able to work on the slope.",0,2101
15694,Salah, Operation…specialist. What do you think?,0,2101
15695,Ashley," Who is the operation specialist? Me? No, I’m //meteorology specialist.",0,2101

15727,Will," Yes. So, what is it…So, the time is very important.",0,2101
15728,Salah," And, moreover, robotics and the rover’s parts consumption. Plus, the material…My goal is to minimize the cost of //consumption.",0,2101
15729,Will," So, I understand that",0,2101
15730,Will," Your goal, what you have to do – how much time for drilling. How much time it takes to drill.",0,2101
15731,Salah, Yeah.,0,2101
15732,Will," And minimize how much it costs, right?",0,2101

15735,Salah, Yeah.,0,2101
15736,Will," Okay, so, you have two things: the time of drilling needs to be low, and the second thing is that you minimize cost, correct?",0,2101
15737,Ashley," Time of drilling, okay.",0,2101
15738,Salah, Yep.,0,2101

15743,Will," So, your first goal is to also reduce the cost?",0,2101
15744,Katya," No, shorten the time, namely…",0,2101

15940,Will," Okay. Good. Now, tell us about your work and…",0,2101
15941,Vika," I am a hydrogeologist. I have three tasks: water quantity, water quality and water use. The amount of water means that we have to help choose a site that will be as large as possible.",0,2101
15942,Vika," And the quality of the water means that the composition of the water and contamination are important, and, besides, it is important for me…",0,2101
15943,Will, So …,0,2101
15944,Vika," Ease of use. That is, the convenience of wells for future inhabitants of Mars.",0,2101

15956,Vika," Well, yes.",0,2101
15957,Will," Oh, I can’t see yours, yes. And how about…okay, I’m just clarifying here. So, …what…what specification is the most important one for you in this?",0,2101
15958,Maybe Oleg, [SL] Also.,0,2101
15959,Vika, These are the specifications. The most important one is…,0,2101
15960,Oleg, [UI].,0,2101
15961,Vika," what I listed. It’s the impurities; it’s the flow of water. That is, I need to determine in which layers",0,2101
15962,Will, Okay.,0,2101
15963,Vika, we need to be located. That’s the most important thing.,0,2101
15964,Will," Good. Okay, I will continue then. If you didn’t catch that,",0,2101
15965,Will," her goals fit deeply with the actual task force as the hydrologist. So, the amount of water that is coming out. Is it the quality of the water?",0,2101
15966,Vika," Yes, water quality and water contamination.",0,2101
15967,Will, The quality of the water and the contamination of water. And the third one?,0,2101
15968,Vika," Well, also as many people as possible should receive…",0,2101
15969,Will," And how much water flow. So, it’s when…Okay. Now, what is this here //some things…",0,2101
15970,Katya," //So, the location does matter, correct? For you.",0,2101
15971,Vika," Well, by these parameters [UI]",0,2101
15972,Salah, Depth.,0,2101
15973,Will," So, yeah. Those follow very closely with the task force goals themselves. So, this tracks the group’s goals. Okay. For me, it is how much water this place loses. That is, it’s some point. How much it loses; how much it…",0,2101
15974,Oleg, Loses what?,0,2101
15975,Will, Water from a certain point.,0,2101
15976,Will," Yes? So, the amount of water that it loses. Now…",0,2101
15977,Ashley, The amount of water that the well loses?,0,2101
15978,Will," Yes, so…not the well – the area. So, how [SL] promitable it is. So, essentially, average water loss. So, and…shoot, how can I look this up quickly; how can I translate this into Russian?",0,2101
15979,Ashley, Remind me what your title is.,0,2101
15980,Salah, And your job is?,0,2101

15985,Will, Sedimentologist.,0,2101
15986,Alex, Here are the answers.,0,2101
15987,Will, Average water loss – //that’s it’s called.,0,2101
15988,Oleg, //And then [UI] corrected.,0,2101
15989,Will," And loss at recharge. So, also the recharge loss and that depends on, again, loss related to [SL] promitability here. So, you’ll see that come up. And intrasource flow loss or loss of low in the source. So, the water going in between the two, which…",0,2101
15990,Will," you’ll see that as CA or UCA. Okay. Well, what is this…",0,2101
15991,Ashley, Yours is complicated.,0,2101
15992,Will," Well, I think we’re all complicated. Maybe I’m just making it more complicated myself, so…Alright, now…Okay.",0,2101
15993,Ryan," So, pay attention real quick. Pay attention to your chats if you’re not already. Teammates from Chicago will be communicating with you there.",0,2101
15994,Salah," So, we should answer them all or…",0,2101
15995,Ryan, Answer them. Communicate what they are saying to the rest of the group. \,0,2101
15996,Oleg," [UI]. Oh, interacting.",0,2101
15997,Ryan, If there is something important.,0,2101

16004,Salah, [UI],0,2101
16005,Woman1, [SL]What? It disappeared??,0,2101
16006,Ryan, We have twenty-five minutes to choose the location for the well.,0,2101
16007,Woman1, //It disappeared?,0,2101
16008,Ashle,"//No, it’s there. It’s there. It’s just different chats, yeah.",0,2101
16009,Woman1," Oh, okay.",0,2101

16015,Igor, Twenty-fives are left to agree. To choose a point.,0,2101
16016,Ashley, Just making sure [UI] is talking to me. Just like in the //factors team. Yes.,0,2101
16017,Will, //Okay.,0,2101
16018,Salah," So, who should we talk to?",0,2101
16019,Will, How’s that…,0,2101
16020,Igor," Pay attention to the messages you receive from your group. And, in some cases, it is sometimes useful to voice them for the whole team here.",0,2101
16021,Will," Yeah, so, I will see. I am now seeing that the people from the team of geologists – they said that they already have some points.",0,2101
16022,Will," So, from the geologists…the geology team we already…they are saying that they already have some suggestions and coordinates. So, just FYI. I’m sure we all have heard a few things from our teams thus far. But, yes, we do have some suggestions about coordinates coming from geology team at this point. Continue.",0,2101
16023,Oleg," Now, I have received a message from the engineering group, in which they say that they are waiting for the decision of the geologists regarding the location, and then they are trying…",0,2101
16024,Oleg, Or they will start working according to the rules that were specified.,0,2101
16025,Will," Okay. I told them – from the geologist group – that within fifteen or twenty minutes we would have some idea. So, now let’s continue.",0,2101
16026,Oleg, Yes.,0,2101
16027,Will, What are your activities?,0,2101
16028,Oleg, My activity is to use the knowledge and experience about the projective filtering system.,0,2101
16029,Will, What is it called?,0,2101
16030,Oleg, Biomechanical engineer.,0,2101
16031,Will, Okay.,0,2101
16032,Ashley, You said biochemical?,0,2101
16033,Oleg, Yes.,0,2101
16034,Will, Biochemical or…,0,2101
16035,Oleg," Consequently, my responsibilities include designing a filtration system based on the characteristics of the ground to be taken; and what filtration steps we will implement.",0,2101
16036,Will," Okay. So, the first point, the most important thing is what exactly?",0,2101
16037,Oleg, We need to determine from what ground and from what location we will take it.,0,2101
16038,Oleg," in order to further determine the power of the pump, //that will be suitable.",0,2101
16039,Will," Okay, so, I take it the first one is the ground? Yes. //Through which...",0,2101
16040,Oleg," //Yes, the ground and what is in it. How contaminated water will pass through it. And I need to determine the number of steps and the quality of the filters.",0,2101
16041,Will," Okay, so, the first thing that we’re looking at here, is the soil, the quality of the soil and how much… I mean, pump water…how it can pump water…",0,2101
16042,Oleg," Yes, it is important for me that I understand the quality of the water //and how to filter it.",0,2101
16043,Will," //And the quality of water. So, the type of soil and the quality of water that comes out of soil.",0,2101
16044,Oleg," In the future, how many steps I should take to ensure the filtration of this water.",0,2101
16045,Will, Okay.,0,2101
16046,Oleg," And, in the future, determine how many steps I will use to filter this water.",0,2101
16047,Will," That is, //stages – like, one time, two times…",0,2101
16048,Oleg," //Stages. Yes, yes, yes. The thing is that there are several of them",0,2101
16049,Oleg, types of filtration.,0,2101
16050,Will, Okay.,0,2101
16051,Oleg," Rough, fine and with all the [UI]",0,2101
16052,Will, And how many layers the actual…,0,2101
16053,Igor, filtration.,0,2101
16054,Oleg, Yes.,0,2101
16055,Will, Filtration has…//filtration?,0,2101
16056,Igor, //Stages of filtration.,0,2101
16057,Will, Okay. Good.,0,2101
16058,Oleg," And, it is very important, so as not to re-read here, it is very important that the water is less contaminated with small things. For example, mineral contaminants or sand, because it will clog the filters and, consequently, it will require an increase in the power of the pumps.",0,2101
16059,Will, So.,0,2101
16060,Will," Ground type, water quality and filtration levels.",0,2101
16061,Oleg," Yes. Well, first, maybe... remove the ground, because this is already a derivative of what there will be in the water. Remove the ground. Take away.",0,2101
16062,Will, But this…What did you find out when reading? What was it exactly?,0,2101
16063,Oleg, I need the degree of water contamination and the degree of filtration.,0,2101
16064,Will," So, the quality of the water and the stages…",0,2101
16065,Oleg, Filtration.,0,2101
16066,Will, Filtration. Okay. And the stages of filtration.,0,2101
16067,Ryan, Did you all get these quizzes that pop up?,0,2101
16068,Ryan, You need to complete them as you’re working.,0,2101
16069,Igor, There will sometimes be questions on the screen. You need to answer.,0,2101
16070,Will," So, okay. //So, did you catch that? Quality of water and the filtration stages //the water has to go through to be of quality.",0,2101
16071,Salah, //Filtration stages and the quality of water.,0,2101
16072,Oleg and Alex, //[UI],0,2101
16073,Will," okay, so…",0,2101
16074,Oleg, Now who?,0,2101
16075,Alex, To whom [SL] do you extend your idea?,0,2101
16076,Will," So, now we are listening to Ashley. Let’s continue. We’ll listen to Ashley real quick. //Ashley, go ahead and give us your shot.",0,2101
16077,Ashley," //Yeah, just really quickly. So,",0,2101

16100,Will," //Okay. So, she is a meteorologist for Mars.",0,2101
16101,Ashley," Which means that I focus on the microclimates of Mars. So, the dust storms that affect the water quality, for example. And so, I am trying to minimize the meteorology costs",0,2101
16102,Will, minimize…,0,2101
16103,Ashley, that are associated with using the wells.,0,2101
16104,Salah, okay.,0,2101

17571,Video, To the mission analysis group back on Earth.,1,2101
17572,Ryan, Is that a touch screen?,1,2101
17573,Video," Due to channel restriction… The Project Red Relay is a complex network routing task. Once your task force has planned the water infrastructure on Mars, you will be routing information to the mission analysis group back on Earth. Due to channel restriction issues, you will only have direct contact with two of the individuals in your task force. Twelve individuals, including your six-person Sirius crew and six mission support members. In the Project Red Relay",1,2101
17574,Video," you will choose two people who will be most effective in helping you relay any information you receive to anyone else in the larger group. Remember, each other person in the task force is also choosing two people to maintain communication with. You will complete two information relay tasks. Each one will last for ten minutes. You will receive multiple pieces of information, will need to use your two contacts to route the message to the appropriate specialist within your task force.",1,2101
17575,Video," After the first ten-minute relay task the communication channels will be reset. You will have the option to choose two different people to maintain communication with during the second relay task. The first thing you’ll need to do is log in as your assigned Project RED role. For example, if you are a materials specialist, select the “materials specialist” option from dropdown list. Next, you’ll be asked to select two contacts. All the task force participants will be listed in this menu.",1,2101
17576,Video," From the menu you will choose the two people who you think will be most effective in helping you relay information to the larger group based on their selected contact. When all of the users have selected their contacts, the session will begin. Your job will be to route information toward it’s intended final recipient by choosing which of your two contacts you should send it to. As soon as the task begins, you will receive a message from the system, containing information that another task",1,2101
17577,Video," force member needs. You’ll see that this message has a final recipient indicated at the top and includes a file attachment containing data regarding the mission. Don’t worry about opening the attachment. Your job is simply to forward the message to the contact that you feel is best situated given his or her own contacts to get it to its final recipient. Choose which of your contacts you want to send it to and forward the message. Meanwhile,",1,2101
17578,Video," keep your eyes on your inbox, because as you are sending files to your contacts, others who chose you as a contact, will be sending messages to you to relay it to others. The message will show who you received it from, its path so far and the intended final recipient. Again, you’ll need to relay the message to the contact that you think is best situated, based on the contacts that person chose to get this message to its final recipient. Every two minutes you will receive a new message from the system. Forward each one",1,2101
17579,Video," relaying it to the individual you think is most appropriate, given the intended final recipient. You can also view your sent messages. Here you can see whether they’ve received their final recipient yet. Also, note that on the right-hand side of the page you can see how busy your current contacts are. Contacts will have a number on the side of their title that shows how many messages they currently have in their inbox. Contacts with more messages in their inbox might be slower at relaying messages you send to them.",1,2101
17580,Video," After ten minutes the first task will end. When the session ends you will be taken back to the main page. You will then take part in the second Project RED Relay task. Select your assigned role again and click Log In. due to channel limitations you once again will be able to select two people in the task force, who you want to be able to help route your messages to the rest of the task force. You may select the same contacts as the first time, or you may choose different ones.",1,2101

17582,Ryan, Okay.,1,2101
17583,Katya, [SL] Can you do it? [UI],1,2101
17584,Igor," Okay. There was Russian translation there, but probably not everyone has seen it.",1,2101
17585,Katya," You can, yes, please.",1,2101

17587,Katya," Yes, please.",1,2101
17588,Igor," Please, what?",1,2101
17589,Katya, Please translate everything.,1,2101
17590,Igor," Sure. I will translate everything that’s the most important things. That is, firstly, I will start by saying that this is part of Project RED, but, in fact, it has nothing to do with the first part. The task here is to send and forward messages. You don’t need or have to read them. That is, there is no sense ... that is, there is no meaning in the content of the messages that are transmitted.",1,2101
17591,Igor," The only link to the previous task is the twelve people and the twelve roles. In total, you have a team of twelve people: six here and six there. Well, plus there are six more somewhere, right? A total of twelve. You have limited communication channels. You can send information to only two contacts who you need to determine ahead of time. That is, you choose two people from the list of eleven people from the very beginning who you think, for some",1,2101
17592,Igor," reason, will communicate messages to someone else as efficiently as possible. That is, the rest of the crew or team members. Periodically, once every two minutes, you will receive a message that is generated by the system that will need to be transferred to someone else. The address will be listed there. That is, the final recipient of this message. You need to choose one of your contacts that you think based on all the information you have",1,2101
17593,Igor," information at that moment can effectively pass them on so that it reaches the addressee. You can see at any time where the messages are getting and how effectively those that you have already sent have been transmitted. The whole history of messages ... they can travel in circles, too. Theoretically, it may not reach the addressee. There may not be a logical chain to the addressee. You will see where it came from, who it passed through, and how it got to you.",1,2101
17594,Igor," You can also see the workload of your two specific recipients. That is, how many unsent messages they have. The higher this number, the slower they are likely to work. Well, or more loaded with work. Or maybe they were just chosen, and therefore they have ... well, this should be taken into account when making decisions. That is, a message arrives, you address it to one of the two people, and you hope that it will reach the right place along the chain. That’s what this task is.",1,2101
17595,Igor, It will be performed twice. Ten minutes each session.,1,2101
17596,Oleg," That is, some message is launched and we...",1,2101

17598,Oleg," And, in fact, you observe whether this message has come to the addressee or not.",1,2101
17599,Igor," Whether it came or it didn’t come, yes. That is, you are someone’s contact too. You don’t know how many people will choose you as a contact. Yes? That is, so you can track",1,2101
17600,Igor," where it came from, so that back and forth it ... As if, if ... without the need to send it.",1,2101

18087,Ashley, But it’s like…how much water loss do we actually have there?,0,2119
18088,Will," We actually end up with quite a bit of water. For five twenty-two we end up with hundred thousand. That’s actually the size, as somebody said, of the aquifer after the loss. For eight nineteen we end up eighty-two thousand, which is decent.",0,2119

18907,Will, Seventeen thirty-nine?,0,2105
18908,Ashley, The one we discussed at the beginning.,0,2105
18909,Will, Seventeen thirty-nine?,0,2105
18910,Ashley, Yeah.,0,2105
18911,Will, Okay. I’ve already got it.,0,2105
18912,Vika, For some reason I don't have that point.,0,2105
18913,Oleg, Okay. Turbidity is eighty.,0,2105
18914,Will, That’s it!,0,2105
18915,Ashley, Really?,0,2105

18918,Ashley, Yes.,0,2105
18919,Will, Yeah. Do they say seventeen thirty-nine?,0,2105
18920,Ashley, Yeah.,0,2105
18921,Oleg, Yes. //Possibly.,0,2105
18922,Ashley," //So, my team is saying, “Seventeen thirty-nine is// a good option. It seems to work for us, and…”",0,2105
18923,Vika, //Why are we listening to them?,0,2105
18924,Salah, Which one?,0,2105
18925,Ashle,"// Seventeen thirty-nine, that we said earlier on. That you said that it was good for you too.",0,2105
18926,Oleg," //Contamination, impurities. I have one filter which can remove it all.",0,2105
18927,Vika, Oh really?,0,2105
18928,Oleg, Yes.,0,2105
18929,Ashley, So is it okay or not?,0,2105
18930,Oleg," Yes, yes, yes.",0,2105
18931,Ashley, Yes. He is good.,0,2105
18932,Oleg, It will be at the limit.,0,2105
18933,Ashley, Is it really deep for you?,0,2105
18934,Salah," Still, I didn’t check for it.",0,2105
18935,Ashley, Seventeen thirty-nine. That might be the one that we converge on.,0,2105
18936,Will," He said it was deep, but he said that it was okay.",0,2105
18937,Ashley, Yep.,0,2105
18938,Vika," There will be a massive water loss. Is there enough water, Will?",0,2105
18939,Will, What?,0,2105
18940,Oleg, Does seventeen thirty-nine possess a decent amount of water?,0,2105
18941,Will," Yes, yes, yes.",0,2105
18942,Vika," Ah, it’s okay. The loss is within the norm. The loss is fine.",0,2105
18943,Vika, //Yes. Okay. Seventeen thirty-nine.,0,2105
18944,Ashley," //So, maybe we could…Sorry. One of my specialists says that at seventeen thirty-nine it is impossible to fully eliminate…",0,2105
18945,Will, Huh?,0,2105
18946,Ashley, Eliminate. How do you say it?,0,2105
18947,Will, What...what…,0,2105
18948,Ashley, There is no way to completely eliminate contamination with filters and materials at seventeen thirty-nine.,0,2105
18949,Will, To filter contamination.,0,2105
18950,Oleg, We have a method. We really do.,0,2105
18951,Vika, He is unde....,0,2105
18952,Oleg, The thing is...,0,2105
18953,Will, Yeah.,0,2105
18954,Oleg, You can write to him that the H filters of the third stage allow you to clean up to 85%.,0,2105
18955,Ashley, Can you repeat it once again?,0,2105
18956,Oleg, Filters of the group H allow to clean the water up to 85%.,0,2105
18957,Ashley, Filter H…,0,2105
18958,Oleg, Up to 85%.,0,2105

18961,Ashley, 85%.,0,2105
18962,Ashley, But how much do we need?,0,2105
18963,Oleg, The less the better.,0,2105
18964,Ashley, Is it a drinking water if it's eighty-five or not?,0,2105
18965,Oleg, Drinking water is zero. It means it’s pure.,0,2105
18966,Ashley," I see. Zero means drinking water. So, eighty-five is definitely not for drinking.",0,2105
18967,Oleg," Well, of course. That's what it's filtered for.",0,2105
18968,Ashley," So if you clean it up to eighty-five, then there are 15% left to get drinking water.",0,2105
18969,Oleg, No. There are filters that will allow you to do this to zero.,0,2105
18970,Ashley, Mhm.,0,2105
18971,Oleg," But at the same time, losses will be up to 60%. Since the maximum value of the filters.",0,2105
18972,Ashley," So, at seventeen thirty-nine, you can only clean up to 85%.",0,2105
18973,Oleg, Yes.,0,2105
18974,Ashley, So it’s not the best point.,0,2105
18975,Oleg, Obviously it’s not. But technically it is possible.,0,2105
18976,Vika, No.,0,2105
18977,Will, May I have some fruits?,0,2105
18978,Vika, Sure. Do we have some? Would you like nuts?,0,2105

18985,Vika," No, I mean...Will...",0,2105

18999,Salah, Twenty-five three? Who said it before?,0,2105
19000,Ashley, I did...Why?,0,2105
19001,Salah, Because they are asking about it. [UI],0,2105
19002,Salah, [SL]Here. [UI],0,2105
19003,Will, Great.,0,2105
19004,Vika, Five thousand.,0,2105

19006,Will," It was alright. It’s not the best for me, but…",0,2105
19007,Vika, Yeah. We can do that.,0,2105
19008,Will, Other people in the geology team can handle it. We can handle it.,0,2105
19009,Oleg, They are looking at us right now and like “Ahh! They eat!”,0,2105
19010,Will," Like, “What the hell is wrong with that guy?”",0,2105
19011,Will," I’d love to see both teams on, like, a big screen with all six going.",0,2105
19012,Ashley," Yeah. So, we can see where everyone’s looking; what are they thinking.",0,2105
19013,Will, And sync the time.,0,2105
19014,Ashley, That would be really cool.,0,2105
19015,Vika, Hm…//nuts are here. You want?,0,2105
19016,Ashley, //These are the last! …There is a prune. I see that Oleg has already eaten everything.,0,2105

19020,Oleg, Someone is too slow.,0,2105

19214,Ashley, Forty-five.,0,2105
19215,Vika, It’s fine basically.,0,2105
19216,Ashley, For me it’s fine too. Maybe even better.,0,2105
19217,Oleg," Well, just, if on those, then we will lose sixty percent.",0,2105
19218,Will," Damn! Now one of them is saying,",0,2105
19219,Will, “Nineteen thirty-four and twenty-five three are the best options”.  But now I’m confused.,0,2105
19220,Ashley," Oh, my people were saying that seventeen thirty-nine.",0,2105
19221,Will," I know. One of them was, too. Maybe this is just a delayed message.",0,2105
19222,Ashley," Maybe. Because ours said, “Seventeen thirty-nine is greater than -- twenty-five thirty is greater than nineteen thirty-four.”",0,2105
19223,Salah," You know, it’s the chain. If I’m in here…if I’m agreeing on my team, they will send it to your team. And they will send it to theirs.",0,2105
19224,Vika," Oleg, are you still looking?",0,2105
19225,Oleg, No. I answer. I was given three options.,0,2105
19226,Will," This means that they are discussing, and it is not clear to them what to choose. So, I now asked operations if they actually chose or not.",0,2105
19227,Vika, What?,0,2105
19228,Ashley," I think it’s delayed, because I sent them my decisions for training and then they, like, “What are your decisions?”. I’m, like, “I just sent them to you.” The delay! Although, six-minute delay is no comparison to our one-week delay for…",0,2105
19229,Will, Fuck!,0,2105
19230,Vika," Yeah. So, did you receive some messages?",0,2105
19231,Ashley," I got something today, yeah.",0,2105
19232,Vika," From past, or…",0,2105
19233,Ashley," No. Actually, it was on time. I think they sent it this morning, so.",0,2105
19234,Vika, Okay.,0,2105
19235,Ashley, But still…I mean everybody else.,0,2105
19236,Vika, What’s up? What have you got?,0,2105
19237,Oleg, Twenty-five thirty is too...,0,2105
19238,Vika, Thirty? Not three?,0,2105
19239,Oleg, Three. Three.,0,2105
19240,Will," Okay! Put the coordinates there, please! I want to continue.",0,2105
19241,Vika," Will, wanna some nuts?",0,2105
19242,Salah, Which point? They are discussing about seventeen thirty-nine.,0,2105
19243,Ashley, I think so.,0,2105
19244,Will," Oh, wait. Hold up. Something…",0,2105
19245,Ashley, Uh-oh. What?,0,2105
19246,Will, Fluid engineer is going nuts. //Fluid engineer started trying to…,0,2105
19247,Ashley, //Fluid engineer. What’s up with the engineering team? Come on!,0,2105
19248,Will, What are they trying to do with my guy? Okay. Structural.,0,2105
19249,Salah, It has been reset by it?,0,2105
19250,Ashley," Okay. //Oh, I didn’t even know that it was already…",0,2105
19251,Will," //Yeah, because the fluid…fluid…No, no. Fluid boy started smashing the signoff button.",0,2105
19252,Ashley, Oh.,0,2105
19253,Will, Instead of…,0,2105
19254,Oleg," So, what are we going to choose?",0,2105
19255,Will, //We're just waiting for them to put a point there.,0,2105
19256,Salah, //What should we actually do to be signing off?,0,2105
19257,Ashley, I think that they have to decide on their side.,0,2105
19258,Oleg, I have the same percentage everywhere. I use maximum filters everywhere.,0,2105
19259,Will," Then just sit and wait until... If you've already set your things, you've already set them. If not, then we wait.",0,2105
19260,Oleg," The thing is that where it is clean, there is no water. Where there is water, it is muddy everywhere and this is the maximum filtration.",0,2105
19261,Oleg, There will be losses anyway.,0,2105
19262,Vika, Does everybody fill out already?,0,2105
19263,Oleg, Are you filling out?,0,2105
19264,Ashley," They said that maintenance filters are A, D and H for stage one, two and three. If that means anything to you, guys. For me it does, so, A, D, H.",0,2105
19265,Oleg, No one has filled out for me yet.,0,2105
19266,Vika," Five minute delay, right?",0,2105
19267,Oleg, Three.,0,2105
19268,Ashley, Three to one side.,0,2105
19269,Oleg, They are at seventeen thirty-nine.,0,2105
19270,Vika, It seems to me that it can simply be called “struck”.,0,2105
19271,Will, Okay. We need to wait.,0,2105
19272,Vika, Nuts? You want?,0,2105
19273,Ashley, One moment. I’ve got to get my stuff in.,0,2105
19274,Will, I guess it’s already in there.,0,2105
19275,Ashley, Yeah. It looks like my team entered the things for me. That I had mentioned in the chat.,0,2105
19276,Vika, That’s it? Have we chosen this point? That’s it. Great.,0,2105
19277,Oleg, Which one? Which one?,0,2105
19278,Will, Seventeen thirty-nine. Okay. We’re making good progress. Let’s get it. Let’s get it!,0,2105
19279,Salah, Which one?,0,2105
19280,Will, We are ready to sign off. Did you get everything filled in? You ready to go to sign off?,0,2105
19281,Vika, How did you do it?,0,2105
19282,Will, What do you mean?,0,2105
19283,Vika, How did you put that point?,0,2105
19284,Will, Which one? It’s they who did.,0,2105
19285,Ashley, They did it.,0,2105
19286,Vika," Oh, okay.",0,2105
19287,Salah," So, we should fill it?",0,2105
19288,Ashley," Yeah, if you are ready to sign off.",0,2105
19289,Ashley, They probably filled it in based on the chat stuff.,0,2105
19290,Vika," Oh, drilling specialist…specialist.",0,2105
19291,Ashley, Manuel Alger.,0,2105
19292,Vika, What?,0,2105
19293,Ashley," It says Manuel Alger but, like, I was trying to make it funny, like it’s a name.",0,2105
19294,Vika, Alright. Funny.,0,2105
19295,Ashley, It wasn’t funny at all.,0,2105
19296,Salah," So, which point they chose?",0,2105
19297,Ashley, Seventeen thirty-nine.,0,2105
19298,Vika, Sign.,0,2105
19299,Oleg, What?,0,2105

19301,Oleg, Now I will choose which filter is better.,0,2105
19302,Ashley, You can’t choose anymore. There is already.,0,2105
19303,Vika, It seems to be filled in automatically.,0,2105
19304,Oleg, Mhm.,0,2105
19305,Ashley," They gave A, D, H.",0,2105
19306,Will," Oleg, have you pressed yet?",0,2105
19307,Oleg, Not yet. …Now I will choose.,0,2105
19308,Salah, I signed off.,0,2105
19309,Ashley, Me too.,0,2105
19310,Salah, Who still…,0,2105
19311,Oleg, Did you do it?,0,2105

19314,Ashley," Oh, fuck! Did I not?",0,2105
19315,Vika, What? What?,0,2105
19316,Ashley, I thought I did but I couldn’t. Do you guys see me signed off or no?,0,2105
19317,Salah, No.,0,2105
19318,Will, Looks like it’s…I think we’re good.,0,2105
19319,Salah, We are doing…,0,2105
19320,Will," Alright, and which one do we…which survey do we have to fill out now?",0,2105
19321,Salah, No survey.,0,2105

20477,Igor," You might’ve learned something. Maybe you didn’t. Maybe, you understood something…",0,2102
20478,Oleg," Well, overall, there’s this idea that…Oh. Again. Or we are supposed to agree in advance who communicates with whom and we all interact…in advance.",0,2102
20479,Will, I think…,0,2102
20480,Vika, But why?,0,2102
20481,Oleg," But the thing is that, see, I already have messages that have circled around.",0,2102
20482,Oleg," So, one person has already picked me, and I picked them. //And this person…",0,2102
20483,Vika, //But you can pick some other person.,0,2102
20484,Oleg, What?,0,2102
20485,Vika, You simply choose a different person.,0,2102
20486,Will, Yes.,0,2102
20487,Oleg, No.,0,2102
20488,Katya," Maybe, we should establish a system based on our roles? For example, choose so that I have two…I choose such that the specialist is bipolar,",0,2102
20489,Igor, I…,0,2102
20490,Katya, at least.,0,2102
20491,Igor," I wanted to tell you that you can now sit here, because at first I kept my computer here. One person can now sit here. You are sitting so close together. You can now find different spots for sitting.",0,2102
20492,Oleg, Really?,0,2102
20493,Igor, You can now.,0,2102
20494,Vika, I would like to sit on the floor.,0,2102
20495,Will," Well…yes, yes. Okay.",0,2102
20496,Igor, You can change where you are sitting now.,0,2102
20497,Will, Okay. I will go sit in a different place.,0,2102
20498,Igor," Well, no. We can just spread out a bit.",0,2102
20499,Will, Okay.,0,2102
20500,Katya, Is that necessary?,0,2102
20501,Igor," No, no. You don’t have to. //You just can.",0,2102
20502,Katya, I can stay in my place.,0,2102
20503,Igor, No. Two people on one side and two people on the other so that…,0,2102
20504,Vika," A, okay.",0,2102
20505,Igor, So we are not too close together.,0,2102
20506,Will, Thank you…Now we can…,0,2102

20513,Igor, Twenty something.,0,2102
20514,Vika, [UI],0,2102
20515,Igor," Yeah, so, you [SL] come forward.",0,2102
20516,Oleg," Well, are there any other suggestions?",0,2102
20517,Igor, We can talk.,0,2102
20518,Will, [UI],0,2102
20519,Oleg," I got the impression that I accidentally chose somebody that had chosen me. But it’s somebody that is not here. It is probably from somewhere in Chicago…//, and we practically to each other…",0,2102
20520,Igor, //I will say right away. We are pretty limited in terms of time today.,0,2102
20521,Igor," Well, because we have people waiting there. So, you can talk about this quickly, but then we should start. You can then do something next time. Okay?",0,2102
20522,Oleg, Yes.,0,2102
20523,Igor, It’s just that the time is not //limitless.,0,2102
20524,Vika, Are we choosing or are we agreeing?,0,2102
20525,Oleg, Yes. We are choosing.,0,2102
20526,Ashley, Choosing.,0,2102
20527,Vika, Okay.,0,2102
20528,Katya," We can’t decide and agree, right?",0,2102
20529,Igor," Well, you can. You can but…",0,2102
20530,Katya," Perhaps, we should broaden it so that…",0,2102
20531,Will, Can we now?,0,2102
20532,Igor, Yes.,0,2102
20533,Will, Great. Cool!,0,2102

20542,Will," If you don’t know, just give it to somebody.",0,2102
20543,Vika, Yes.,0,2102
20544,Will, There is no need to sit on them. It’s not like that will help.,0,2102
20545,Salah, [SL] Sorry.,0,2102

20549,Katya," Just a sec, just a sec.",0,2102
20550,Will, This is the time to actually do something cool.,0,2102
20551,Oleg, The thing here is to give it to someone that can receive and process it as quickly as possible. But not to the person that sent it to you.,0,2102
20552,Vika," Well, not necessarily. Maybe, you will send it back. Of course, you will exchange messages for a while, but then the one that sent it to you will send it on to somebody else.",0,2102
20553,Oleg," But if that person sent it to you, it means that he or she looked and nothing…",0,2102
20554,Will," But, maybe, that person did it quickly. Perhaps, they did not think about it.",0,2102
20555,Will," Perhaps, he or she //thought it was for you, but maybe another person on their team can send it to someone else. We don’t know. Just think about it and give it to someone. The quicker the better.",0,2102
20556,Vika," //Yes, yes…I agree.",0,2102
20557,Oleg," //Okay, so…",0,2102
20558,Oleg," Well, //I have two crew members that were",0,2102
20559,Ashley, //[SL] Everyone was here. Yes?,0,2102
20560,Will, Okay. Let’s roll. “Skip this tutorial.” Okay.,0,2102
20561,Oleg," Oh, so…",0,2102
20562,Will, Good evening.,0,2102
20563,Oleg," Where? Last time, it was all very dynamic. I don’t write so many messages in one day.",0,2102
20564,Katya," Oleg, it’s just that this time we are not the popular ones",0,2102
20565,Oleg," Yes. I chose somebody wrong, so that I…",0,2102
20566,Katya, //Wow! I have an assignment…,0,2102
20567,Salah," //So, I know now who was messaging me before.",0,2102

20570,Salah, [SL]Now you’re pushing it too.,0,2102
20571,Katya, Yeah?,0,2102
20572,Oleg," Next, next, next, next.",0,2102
20573,Oleg, This is again just instructions. Complete the assignments too. Okay. Next. …And…I have a feeling that they are playing their own game there in Chicago.,0,2102
20574,Vika, I want to play in your sandbox.,0,2102
20575,Oleg, Yes. So now what? Oh!,0,2102
20576,Oleg, Where?!,0,2102
20577,Ashley, Still nothing?,0,2102
20578,Oleg," Let’s not write! Ourselves then? …Oh, we have happier people here.",0,2102
20579,Will," Cool, cool, cool. Cool, cool, cool.",0,2102
20580,Vika, Hm. Rather [UI],0,2102
20581,Oleg, Wow.,0,2102
20582,Katya, What an amazing letter.,0,2102
20583,Oleg," Oh, please this one goes there. [UI]",0,2102
20584,Ashley, [UI],0,2102
20585,Oleg, [UI] with speed…So…,0,2102
20586,Salah," Hm…Now I got it! …So, Igor! If this message contained me,",0,2102
20587,Salah," I have to make it like this, right? Destination – me. Right?",0,2102
20588,Ashley, You mean the final message. I think you’re fine. It would just…,0,2102
20589,Igor, No. Those would be the messages that you receive.,0,2102
20590,Salah," Yeah, but this is the…this is me. This is my job. Yeah, where should I keep it?",0,2102
20591,Igor," No, it should.",0,2102
20592,Salah," Okay, will…",0,2102
20593,Igor, Is that you?,0,2102
20594,Salah, Yeah. That’s my job.,0,2102
20595,Ashley, You’re maintenance costs? Upkeeping maintenance?,0,2102
20596,Salah, Maintenance and robots. Cost of robots and rovers.,0,2102
20597,Ashley, I thought you were materials specialist.,0,2102
20598,Igor, Were you…,0,2102
20599,Salah," Yeah, this is me.",0,2102
20600,Ashley, Okay. Because I would think that that would fall more under maintenance specialist and not materials specialist.,0,2102
20601,Salah," No, it is one of my main things.",0,2102
20602,Ashley," One of, but maybe you’re not the best person to be final.",0,2102
20603,Igor," You are materials specialist, right?",0,2102
20604,Salah, Yeah.,0,2102
20605,Katya, But we’re in one group with Abdulla.,0,2102

20609,Oleg, No. Something is not right here.,0,2102
20610,Katya, [UI],0,2102
20611,Oleg," We had the last one, it’s just…",0,2102

20645,Oleg, This here. Where you see “sent” – that is everything.,0,2102
20646,Salah, Yes.,0,2102

20677,Vika, I’ll refresh.,0,2102
20678,Oleg, Just look in the history who sent it to whom. What “complete” stops at. Who is connected with whom.,0,2102
20679,Katya, But here in the end…,0,2102
20680,Vika," Yes, of course, we can look in the history.",0,2102
20681,Oleg," Yes. You look in the history, and you can see who is forwarding it to whom.",0,2102
20682,Oleg, And the branches…here – it’s not for no reason that they are there. And even the whole network many have been deciphered already.,0,2102
20683,Katya," Here, we have a message that got stuck with the Martian Terrain specialist…We have it here.",0,2102
20684,Oleg," In general, we could have sent them to all twelve and among them see which one can…More precisely, not who can send to whom, but who has already sent it to whom. And then the whole scheme will be known.",0,2102
20685,Oleg," So, this is [UI]. [UI]",0,2102
20686,Oleg," What’s good is that either because of the number of messages…I have all the messages delivered. …or they simply can’t get out of some never-ending loop there. Abdulla, I see you are also bored.",0,2102
20687,Salah, I…,0,2102

20697,Katya, I am trying to choose so as not to repeat it.,0,2102

996,Will," Yeah, I asked the operations specialist and the structural geologist.",1,12103
997,Ashley," If twenty-four fourteen doesn’t work, I think that we should resort back to thirty-two fifteen because…",1,12103

1043,Saleh, He said he can’t do “twenty-four fourteen”.,1,12103

1086,Saleh, Why? What’s the reason?,1,12103
1087,Katya," For me, it’s okay.",1,12103
1088,Ashley," Because there are seven, six and three respectively yellow orange red zones which means that there’s gonna be a lot of dust storms. Why did we go with that one?",1,12103

4554,Ashley," So, if we were to rank…",0,12107

4561,Will, Okay.,0,12107
4562,Salah, Did you get a…because I’m asking about twenty-nine thirty-two. I didn’t get any reply. Did you?,0,12107

7562,Will," //There is no water, so…",0,12105
7563,Ashley, It’s too bad.,0,12105
7564,Oleg, I have a feeling that the most important thing is to have water in there.,0,12105
7565,Salah, //That’s good.,0,12105
7566,Will, //Well...that is...really important.,0,12105
7567,Salah, This is good.,0,12105

7601,Will," Twenty-six twenty…Fifteen thirty-six. Almost no water. There is, like, nine hundred there, or something.",0,12105
7602,Oleg," Does this mean that we cancel seventeen thirty-eight, right? There is no water, is it?",0,12105
7603,Ashley, Seventeen thirty-eight?,0,12105
7604,Oleg, Yes.,0,12105
7605,Ashley," No. We offered this, did we?",0,12105
7606,Oleg, Yes. Shall we keep it or....,0,12105

7619,Oleg," If there //a large supply of water, then it would be possible.",0,12105
7620,Ashley, //How is it for you?,0,12105
7621,Vika, There is enough water supply. And the water loss is small.,0,12105
7622,Salah, This is good. Sixteen eighteen.,0,12105
7623,Vika, Okay.,0,12105
7624,Ashley, It's not good for you or...,0,12105
7625,Oleg," Well, the point is that there will be losses, but at least it means that there is water and it can be purified.",0,12105
7626,Ashley, How much water is there? I mean is there plenty or not.,0,12105
7627,Will, There is…hold on. There is fifty thousand there. As opposed to two hundred fourteen thousand on the other one.,0,12105
7628,Salah, What’s your requirement?,0,12105
7629,Will, But it’s …,0,12105
7630,Ashley, So as we see…,0,12105
7631,Will, I mean…We want above fifty thousand. Fifty thousand is our minimum cutoff.,0,12105
7632,Salah, Fifty thousand?,0,12105
7633,Will, Yeah.,0,12105
7634,Salah, Above.,0,12105
7635,Will," Whereas the other one…it’s like…Yeah, fifty thousand of usable water. Because there is also average water loss. So…",0,12105
7636,Oleg," What is most interesting, here, along the channel up this ...so-called river ...",0,12105
7637,Salah, I have a good idea. Let Will check if there is water and then we should after.,0,12105
7638,Will," Yeah…So, yeah. So, we have…",0,12105
7639,Ashley, What about anything in that lower left corner?,0,12105
7640,Ashley, Is anything there good //for you? No?,0,12105
7641,Oleg, //How about this? Nineteen thirty-five.,0,12105
7642,Oleg, Very clean water. I don't know what is there...,0,12105

7670,Will, Yes. //Nineteen thirty-five will probably work.,0,12105
7671,Ashley, //So it's not okay.,0,12105
7672,Will," This is like right on the border of what we can accept, but ...",0,12105
7673,Vika, Not the best point.,0,12105
7674,Ashley, It’s not?,0,12105
7675,Will, What is next?,0,12105
7676,Salah," So, what do you think about it?",0,12105
7677,Will, Nineteen thirty-five?,0,12105
7678,Salah, Yeah.,0,12105
7679,Will, It’s passable.,0,12105

7704,Oleg, What about the supplies?,0,12105
7705,Vika, [UI],0,12105
7706,Ashley," Not the best for me. Lots of red zones. This means that the weather there is not very good, but…",0,12105
7707,Vika, Nineteen thirty-four — no way. Really?,0,12105
7708,Vika, Okay.,0,12105
7709,Ashley, Not the best one.,0,12105
7710,Salah, It’s not good with you?,0,12105
7711,Ashley," Yeah. It’s not the best. There is a lot of red zones, which means that there is a…Oh, there’s a message from my team. They said “Hello. We are all in //different places today. So sorry for the delay."" They're looking at seventeen thirty-eight now.",0,12105
7712,Salah, //But what’s…The number of contaminants is really high?,0,12105

7746,Will, I got this wrong. It was seventeen thirty-nine.,0,12105
7747,Oleg, Yes.,0,12105
7748,Will, The one I was talking about. It was okay. Seventeen thirty-eight — no. I mixed it up when I was saying that.,0,12105

7983,Ashley, But it could be...,0,12105
7984,Vika, Just checked.,0,12105
7985,Will, But if there is so much water...,0,12105
7986,Ashley, How high? Because maybe we could clean it up.,0,12105
7987,Vika, One minute.,0,12105

8020,Oleg, This is your questionnaire.,0,12105
8021,Vika, So what? We do it with everyone.,0,12105
8022,Oleg, Yes.,0,12105
8023,Ashley, I give the same answers to the questions almost every time.,0,12105
8024,Oleg," In fact, we are discussing it among us.",0,12105
8025,Ashley, Yes.,0,12105
8026,Oleg, And we have our own team.,0,12105
8027,Ashley, So my team chose our first offer — seventeen thirty nine...,0,12105
8028,Oleg, Thirty-eight.,0,12105
8029,Ashley, We changed it to thirty-nine because William said it was better. They said it was a good option for them.,0,12105
8030,Vika, And the last one is nineteen thirty-four?,0,12105
8031,Ashley," It works for them too, but nineteen thirty-four — the weather is worse there. There are big red zones.",0,12105
8032,Vika, Okay.,0,12105
8033,Ashley, So what?,0,12105
8034,Vika, And the previous?,0,12105

8041,Will, Seventeen thirty-nine?,0,12105
8042,Ashley, Yeah.,0,12105
8043,Will, Okay. I’ve already got it.,0,12105
8044,Vika, For some reason I don't have that point.,0,12105
8045,Oleg, Okay. Turbidity is eighty.,0,12105

8050,Ashley, Yes.,0,12105
8051,Will, Yeah. Do they say seventeen thirty-nine?,0,12105
8052,Ashley, Yeah.,0,12105
8053,Oleg, Yes. //Possibly.,0,12105
8054,Ashley," //So, my team is saying, “Seventeen thirty-nine is// a good option. It seems to work for us, and…”",0,12105

8056,Salah, Which one?,0,12105
8057,Ashle,"// Seventeen thirty-nine, that we said earlier on. That you said that it was good for you too.",0,12105

8059,Vika, Oh really?,0,12105
8060,Oleg, Yes.,0,12105
8061,Ashley, So is it okay or not?,0,12105
8062,Oleg," Yes, yes, yes.",0,12105
8063,Ashley, Yes. He is good.,0,12105
8064,Oleg, It will be at the limit.,0,12105
8065,Ashley, Is it really deep for you?,0,12105
8066,Salah," Still, I didn’t check for it.",0,12105
8067,Ashley, Seventeen thirty-nine. That might be the one that we converge on.,0,12105
8068,Will," He said it was deep, but he said that it was okay.",0,12105
8069,Ashley, Yep.,0,12105
8070,Vika," There will be a massive water loss. Is there enough water, Will?",0,12105
8071,Will, What?,0,12105
8072,Oleg, Does seventeen thirty-nine possess a decent amount of water?,0,12105
8073,Will," Yes, yes, yes.",0,12105
8074,Vika," Ah, it’s okay. The loss is within the norm. The loss is fine.",0,12105
8075,Vika, //Yes. Okay. Seventeen thirty-nine.,0,12105
8076,Ashley," //So, maybe we could…Sorry. One of my specialists says that at seventeen thirty-nine it is impossible to fully eliminate…",0,12105
8077,Will, Huh?,0,12105
8078,Ashley, Eliminate. How do you say it?,0,12105
8079,Will, What...what…,0,12105
8080,Ashley, There is no way to completely eliminate contamination with filters and materials at seventeen thirty-nine.,0,12105
8081,Will, To filter contamination.,0,12105
8082,Oleg, We have a method. We really do.,0,12105
8083,Vika, He is unde....,0,12105
8084,Oleg, The thing is...,0,12105
8085,Will, Yeah.,0,12105
8086,Oleg, You can write to him that the H filters of the third stage allow you to clean up to 85%.,0,12105
8087,Ashley, Can you repeat it once again?,0,12105
8088,Oleg, Filters of the group H allow to clean the water up to 85%.,0,12105
8089,Ashley, Filter H…,0,12105
8090,Oleg, Up to 85%.,0,12105
8091,Ashley, …can clean up to 80%? Eighty?,0,12105

8093,Ashley, 85%.,0,12105
8094,Ashley, But how much do we need?,0,12105
8095,Oleg, The less the better.,0,12105
8096,Ashley, Is it a drinking water if it's eighty-five or not?,0,12105
8097,Oleg, Drinking water is zero. It means it’s pure.,0,12105
8098,Ashley," I see. Zero means drinking water. So, eighty-five is definitely not for drinking.",0,12105
8099,Oleg," Well, of course. That's what it's filtered for.",0,12105
8100,Ashley," So if you clean it up to eighty-five, then there are 15% left to get drinking water.",0,12105
8101,Oleg, No. There are filters that will allow you to do this to zero.,0,12105
8102,Ashley, Mhm.,0,12105
8103,Oleg," But at the same time, losses will be up to 60%. Since the maximum value of the filters.",0,12105
8104,Ashley," So, at seventeen thirty-nine, you can only clean up to 85%.",0,12105
8105,Oleg, Yes.,0,12105
8106,Ashley, So it’s not the best point.,0,12105
8107,Oleg, Obviously it’s not. But technically it is possible.,0,12105
8108,Vika, No.,0,12105
8109,Will, May I have some fruits?,0,12105

8130,Oleg, We have considered it before.,0,12105
8131,Salah, Twenty-five three? Who said it before?,0,12105
8132,Ashley, I did...Why?,0,12105
8133,Salah, Because they are asking about it. [UI],0,12105
8134,Salah, [SL]Here. [UI],0,12105
8135,Will, Great.,0,12105
8136,Vika, Five thousand.,0,12105

8138,Will," It was alright. It’s not the best for me, but…",0,12105
8139,Vika, Yeah. We can do that.,0,12105
8140,Will, Other people in the geology team can handle it. We can handle it.,0,12105
8141,Oleg, They are looking at us right now and like “Ahh! They eat!”,0,12105
8142,Will," Like, “What the hell is wrong with that guy?”",0,12105
8143,Will," I’d love to see both teams on, like, a big screen with all six going.",0,12105
8144,Ashley," Yeah. So, we can see where everyone’s looking; what are they thinking.",0,12105

8316,Ashley, [UI],0,12105
8317,Oleg, One thirty is simply superb. Where the purest water goes.,0,12105

8319,Vika, One thirty or one twenty-eight?,0,12105
8320,Oleg, One thirty.,0,12105
8321,Oleg, There are really great places...,0,12105
8322,Salah, Seems that the guy who is working as a drilling specialist didn’t read the manual. He is just copying and sending answers.,0,12105
8323,Will," Well, yeah, but I mean remember how it was when we first started doing it too.",0,12105
8324,Salah, Yeah.,0,12105
8325,Will," If he is new, he has no clue what the hell he is doing.",0,12105
8326,Salah, Because I’m giving him some options of which is good quality.,0,12105
8327,Will, Mhm.,0,12105
8328,Salah," He is telling me drilling method, which is the worst one.",0,12105
8329,Will," Yeah. Well, I mean, you got used to working with Katya.",0,12105
8330,Salah, It’s so weird. He doesn’t understand.,1,12105
8331,Will," But Katya was injured in a freak drilling accident. So now, she’s getting her arm repaired.",1,12105
8332,Salah, For humanity to Mars.,1,12105
8333,Will, Yeah.,1,12105
8334,Oleg, This one is generally gorgeous — two forty-five. I think everyone will like it.,1,12105
8335,Ashley, Oleg is still ... looking for? Looking for.,1,12105
8336,Will, Which one?,1,12105
8337,Vika, //Two forty-five.,1,12105
8338,Oleg, //Two forty-five.,1,12105
8339,Ashley, What is it?,1,12105
8340,Will, Twenty forty-five.,1,12105
8341,Ashley, Twenty...,1,12105
8342,Vika, //Two forty-five.,1,12105
8343,Oleg, //Two forty-five.,1,12105
8344,Ashley, Two...,1,12105
8345,Oleg, Forty-five.,1,12105
8346,Ashley, Forty-five.,1,12105
8347,Vika, It’s fine basically.,1,12105
8348,Ashley, For me it’s fine too. Maybe even better.,1,12105
8349,Oleg," Well, just, if on those, then we will lose sixty percent.",1,12105
8350,Will," Damn! Now one of them is saying,",1,12105
8351,Will, “Nineteen thirty-four and twenty-five three are the best options”.  But now I’m confused.,1,12105
8352,Ashley," Oh, my people were saying that seventeen thirty-nine.",1,12105
8353,Will," I know. One of them was, too. Maybe this is just a delayed message.",1,12105
8354,Ashley," Maybe. Because ours said, “Seventeen thirty-nine is greater than -- twenty-five thirty is greater than nineteen thirty-four.”",1,12105
8355,Salah," You know, it’s the chain. If I’m in here…if I’m agreeing on my team, they will send it to your team. And they will send it to theirs.",1,12105
8356,Vika," Oleg, are you still looking?",1,12105
8357,Oleg, No. I answer. I was given three options.,1,12105
8358,Will," This means that they are discussing, and it is not clear to them what to choose. So, I now asked operations if they actually chose or not.",1,12105
8359,Vika, What?,1,12105
8360,Ashley," I think it’s delayed, because I sent them my decisions for training and then they, like, “What are your decisions?”. I’m, like, “I just sent them to you.” The delay! Although, six-minute delay is no comparison to our one-week delay for…",1,12105
8361,Will, Fuck!,1,12105
8362,Vika," Yeah. So, did you receive some messages?",1,12105
8363,Ashley," I got something today, yeah.",1,12105
8364,Vika," From past, or…",1,12105
8365,Ashley," No. Actually, it was on time. I think they sent it this morning, so.",1,12105
8366,Vika, Okay.,1,12105
8367,Ashley, But still…I mean everybody else.,1,12105
8368,Vika, What’s up? What have you got?,1,12105
8369,Oleg, Twenty-five thirty is too...,1,12105
8370,Vika, Thirty? Not three?,1,12105
8371,Oleg, Three. Three.,1,12105
8372,Will," Okay! Put the coordinates there, please! I want to continue.",1,12105
8373,Vika," Will, wanna some nuts?",1,12105
8374,Salah, Which point? They are discussing about seventeen thirty-nine.,1,12105
8375,Ashley, I think so.,1,12105
8376,Will," Oh, wait. Hold up. Something…",1,12105
8377,Ashley, Uh-oh. What?,1,12105
8378,Will, Fluid engineer is going nuts. //Fluid engineer started trying to…,1,12105
8379,Ashley, //Fluid engineer. What’s up with the engineering team? Come on!,1,12105
8380,Will, What are they trying to do with my guy? Okay. Structural.,1,12105
8381,Salah, It has been reset by it?,1,12105
8382,Ashley," Okay. //Oh, I didn’t even know that it was already…",1,12105
8383,Will," //Yeah, because the fluid…fluid…No, no. Fluid boy started smashing the signoff button.",1,12105
8384,Ashley, Oh.,1,12105
8385,Will, Instead of…,1,12105
8386,Oleg," So, what are we going to choose?",1,12105
8387,Will, //We're just waiting for them to put a point there.,1,12105
8388,Salah, //What should we actually do to be signing off?,1,12105
8389,Ashley, I think that they have to decide on their side.,1,12105
8390,Oleg, I have the same percentage everywhere. I use maximum filters everywhere.,1,12105
8391,Will," Then just sit and wait until... If you've already set your things, you've already set them. If not, then we wait.",1,12105
8392,Oleg," The thing is that where it is clean, there is no water. Where there is water, it is muddy everywhere and this is the maximum filtration.",1,12105
8393,Oleg, There will be losses anyway.,1,12105
8394,Vika, Does everybody fill out already?,1,12105
8395,Oleg, Are you filling out?,1,12105
8396,Ashley," They said that maintenance filters are A, D and H for stage one, two and three. If that means anything to you, guys. For me it does, so, A, D, H.",1,12105
8397,Oleg, No one has filled out for me yet.,1,12105
8398,Vika," Five minute delay, right?",1,12105
8399,Oleg, Three.,1,12105
8400,Ashley, Three to one side.,1,12105
8401,Oleg, They are at seventeen thirty-nine.,1,12105
8402,Vika, It seems to me that it can simply be called “struck”.,1,12105
8403,Will, Okay. We need to wait.,1,12105
8404,Vika, Nuts? You want?,1,12105
8405,Ashley, One moment. I’ve got to get my stuff in.,1,12105
8406,Will, I guess it’s already in there.,1,12105
8407,Ashley, Yeah. It looks like my team entered the things for me. That I had mentioned in the chat.,1,12105
8408,Vika, That’s it? Have we chosen this point? That’s it. Great.,1,12105
8409,Oleg, Which one? Which one?,1,12105
8410,Will, Seventeen thirty-nine. Okay. We’re making good progress. Let’s get it. Let’s get it!,1,12105

8417,Ashley, They did it.,1,12105

8419,Salah," So, we should fill it?",1,12105
8420,Ashley," Yeah, if you are ready to sign off.",1,12105
8421,Ashley, They probably filled it in based on the chat stuff.,1,12105
8422,Vika," Oh, drilling specialist…specialist.",1,12105
8423,Ashley, Manuel Alger.,1,12105
8424,Vika, What?,1,12105
8425,Ashley," It says Manuel Alger but, like, I was trying to make it funny, like it’s a name.",1,12105
8426,Vika, Alright. Funny.,1,12105
8427,Ashley, It wasn’t funny at all.,1,12105

8434,Ashley, You can’t choose anymore. There is already.,1,12105
8435,Vika, It seems to be filled in automatically.,1,12105
8436,Oleg, Mhm.,1,12105

8438,Will," Oleg, have you pressed yet?",1,12105
