15, //Mark!	,s
16, Do you need a tissue? I’ll put it down there for you guys.	,q

27," No, thank you."	,b
28, We have to make them feel good.	,s
29," Pass it on, please."	,s
30," Yeah, I might’ve been a little overboard there. Oh, shit!"	,s
31, I don’t know if…	,d
32, What? What did you do?	,q
33, Later. When we’re not…	,d
34, Okay.	,f
35," Should I dilute it for you, Will?"	,q
36, Give me half.	,s
37, Okay.	,b
38," It’s okay. It’s recorded, you know?"	,s
39, I know. That’s why it’s…	,d
40," Vika, can you get me just some water?"	,q
41," Yes, sure."	,b
42, Thank you.	,s
43, Do you want it warm or cold?	,q
44, Warm. Warm.	,s
45," I wish they gave us, like…"	,d
46, It can even be hot.	,s
47," A survey, and there we would rate all the experiments. Which one we like and which one we don’t like."	,s
48, Not wet?	,q
49," Poop, sleep, and [SL] Belmont are going to be towards the bottom."	,s
50, Sleep study also.	,s
51," Yeah. Poop, sleep and [SL] Belmont. These three."	,s
52, Please look at twenty-eight twenty-one.	,s
53, Twenty-eight twenty-one.	,s
54," Too good, but I don’t know if there is any water there."	,s
55," Average water loss…//not super, but not too bad."	,s
56, //Why is my decision calculator is not showing?	,q
57," Overall, it’ll do. What?"	,q
58, This thing is not coming up for me. Decision calculator is //not showing up.	,s
59, //Because you’re not cool enough.	,s
60, Log out and try to log in again.	,s
61, Scoff?	,q
62," Ah, there it is."	,s
63, Which point?	,q
64, [SL] I can’t change //my [UI].	,d
65," //Oleg, what point did you have?"	,q
66, Twenty-eight twenty-one.	,s
67, Thank you.	,s
68, Twenty-eight twenty-one.	,b
69, Twenty-one.	,b
70, //Why does it not want to work?	,q
71, //It’s okay.	,s
72, //Yes.	,b
73, There on [UI] only large ones.	,s
74," Yes, yes, yes."	,b
75, Without much loss.	,s
76, Not the worst.	,s
77," Sorry, I still can’t see it because I am having an issue."	,s
78," Is there water, or?"	,q
79, Yeah.	,s
80," So, it’s good for everyone?"	,q
81, Ask them. I still can’t check.	,s
82, I assume there isn’t that much there.	,s
83, Now everything is showing. Okay.	,s
84, Sixty-two.	,s
85, It is very good for me. Did we find our point already?	,q
86, Okay…This one is great – thirteen sixteen.	,s
87, Thirteen sixteen.	,b
88, Sixteen?	,b
89, Thirteen sixteen.	,s
90," Yeah. …Not bad. //In fact, it is very…in fact, it is very good."	,s
91, //Not bad at all.	,s
92, Not too much loss…	,s
93, Because for me the loss is only 10%.	,s
94, Population is much better.	,s
95," Well, I have 69% loss, but there is so much water there that it is not as important."	,s
96, Please tell me what point it is.	,s
97, Thirteen sixteen.	,s
98, Thank you.	,s
99, Okay.	,f
100," The water is murky there, but it is well within the first step of cleaning. Only ten percent loss."	,s
101, It’s okay.	,s
102, I understand that it is okay for Salya too. It’s not too deep.	,s
103, Another similar one – six twenty-nine.	,s
104," Six twenty-nine. It’s not too bad either. I like all of them. Thirteen sixteen is the best in terms of the population, but…"	,d
105," Will, what about you?"	,q
106, Which one?	,q
107, Six twenty-nine.	,s
108, Six twenty-nine. Just a second.	,b
109, I will tell you right now that it is good for Salya. You don’t need it. You will like it.	,s
110, Six twenty…	,b
111, Nine.	,s
112, Six?	,b
113, Six.	,s
114, Twenty…	,s
115, Nine.	,s
116, Okay.	,b
117, No water.	,s
118," Ah, okay. Okay."	,b
119, Perfect.	,b
120," But twenty-eight twenty-one and thirteen sixteen were good in terms of water, correct?"	,q
121," Yes, yes."	,b
122, Cool.	,b
123," So, I have water loss at 10% maximum."	,s
124, Phew.	,b
125," Well, here’s another interesting one – twenty-three six."	,s
126, Twenty-three six …No water.	,s
127, Okay.	,b
128," Today, Oleg was active at first."	,s
129," Today, for me it is for some reason…Usually, I mark points, and they are all…dirty water from which no…"	,d
130," Well, you have found water at 50% today. It is very good."	,s
131," There, yes. But generally speaking, there is practically no clean water. So, we are having to…"	,d
132," Four thirty-nine, please. Four thirty-nine."	,s
133," Worse than those suggested by Oleg, but not too bad."	,s
134, //No water.	,s
135, //No water.	,s
136," Well, okay."	,b
137, And what about forty-two six?	,q
138, Forty-two six.	,b
139, Which one?	,q
140, Forty-two six.	,s
141, No water.	,s
142, Nuts.	,b
143," [SL] Well, okay."	,s
144, Twenty…twenty-five sixteen.	,s
145, Okay. Twenty-five sixteen?	,q
146, Yeah.	,b
147, No water.	,s
148, Careful. The water is hot.	,s
149, No water.	,s
150," By way, for the most part, there is only hot water."	,s
151, How about thirty-six six?	,q
152, Temperature?	,q
153, No water.	,s
154," Well, okay."	,b
155, Why are you starting it? We were communicating just fine.	,q
156, [SL] Do we have a point?	,q
157," Ho ho ho, what about thirty-five two?"	,q
158, Is it your point or they sent you?	,q
159, Mine.	,s
160, Nuts.	,b
161," Oh, no. What’s the matter?"	,q
162," No? Oh, never mind."	,q
163, What? [SL] Sign out.	,q
164, Such water in general…it is at the last one.	,s
165, How could you? Shame! Shame! Shame!	,q
166, Alright! Alright!	,f
167, There it is worse than in a puddle.	,s
168, Between thirteen sixteen and twenty-five twenty-one which one do you like?	,q
169, You mean twenty-eight twenty-one?	,q
170, Huh?	,b
171," It was twenty-eight twenty-one. You said twenty-eight twenty-one, didn’t you?"	,q
172," Yes, twenty-eight twenty-one //and thirteen sixteen."	,s
173, //It was twenty-eight twenty-one.	,s
174, What is “large RIP”?	,q
175, Large RIP…	,b
176, It means that they will put in RIP.	,s
177," Yes, yes. On the grave."	,s
178, Yes. “Large RIP” –  it means that you are not happy…It’s a slang expression for “you are wrong; you’ve made a huge mistake”.	,s
179," Ah, okay."	,b
180, Fatal mistake. RIP.	,s
181, And RIP – is it an acronym or is it a word?	,q
182," //It is an acronym, It …"	,d
183, //Rest in…	,d
184, Rest in peace.	,s
185, Rest in peace.	,s
186," Yes. “Rest in peace”. When people die, they count on it."	,s
187, And we say – “Rest with peace”	,s
188," Oh, yes."	,s
189, What is it in Russian?	,q
190, Rest with peace.	,s
191, Rest with peace?	,b
192, I like the subject today. //Rest quickly!	,s
193, //Quickly! Quickly!	,f
194, Eighteen three.	,s
195, Eighteen three.	,b
196, [UI]	,d
197," Yeah. Drilling suggested, right?"	,q
198, Yeah.	,b
199, Are you and me in the same crew? Robotics?	,q
200, [SL] Sure is.	,s
201, It’s not bad.	,s
202, 100% water loss.	,s
203, Okay. Very bad.	,s
204, It’s too deep also.	,s
205," It’s weird. I don’t think my chat is working, because I wrote in robotics and mine didn’t show up and I’m not getting those."	,s
206, Try from here.	,s
207," No, no. I wrote also in robotics."	,s
208, Weird.	,b
209, It is weird.	,s
210, Have the guys written to somebody?	,q
211, Yeah. They have contacted us.	,s
212, Not me.	,s
213, Twenty-four forty-three.	,s
214," Twenty-four…Very bad. No, no."	,s
215," Which one, Oleg?"	,q
216, Twenty-four forty-three.	,s
217, Twenty-four forty-three. Ash has stopped here.	,s
218," It’s just a thousand liters of water. In short, no water."	,s
219, Operation specialist said: “Chicago vibes have arrived”.	,d
220, Yuck!	,b
221, Yuck! Let’s get rid of it. How could you?	,q
222," Eighteen three. Well, again."	,s
223," No, we already…"	,d
224," Oh, that was the one…okay. I guess that’s the…They say eighteen one."	,s
225, Eighteen one.	,b
226, Eighteen one.	,b
227, Did they look at any of the ones that we suggested yet?	,q
228, It has…	,d
229, Oh! Eighteen one is not too bad for me. Not bad at all.	,s
230, 97% water loss though.	,s
231, Oh.	,b
232, A lot of water loss. //Оh! Why did they go so deep?	,q
233, //Because it’s [UI].	,d
234, It’s// high…high contamination.	,s
235, //Because for me it’s the best option.	,s
236, According to the number of potential population reached. Over nine thousand. And the accessibility is quite high – 75%.	,s
237, Oops.	,f
238," I did it again…Oh baby, baby."	,f
239," Twenty-eight. Perhaps, the surface…"	,s
240, Twenty-eight.	,b
241, Yes.	,b
242, Okay for me.	,b
243, 99% water loss.	,s
244, Nuts.	,b
245," Will, have you understood if there is any correlation with where there is a lot of water? Do you, besides the water basin itself, have some other parameter that would give you an idea?"	,q
246," What do you mean? So, it is…"	,d
247," Well, for me, for example, if it is deep, it may be clean. Surface water is dirtier. So, I can indirectly determine things by the water depth."	,q
248," I have, specifically… specifically, the main formula is the average water loss. It depends on…"	,d
249, On the depth?	,q
250," No. It depends on…there are two layers and there are two types of what the layers consist of. That is what determines the percentage of water loss. That’s all. But it doesn’t really affect it because either it’s already in the calculation, so I don’t have to do anything with it, but just say what percentage of water is lost and how much water there is there..."	,s
251, Let’s write here.	,s
252, Sixteen six? Did anybody check sixteen six?	,q
253, I don’t think so.	,s
254, Sixteen six?	,q
255, Not yet.	,s
256, 100% water loss.	,s
257, Shame.	,b
258, It’s too deep also.	,s
259, Shame. Why? They also //didn’t say anything about the points that we suggested.	,q
260, //[UI]	,d
261, Hm?	,q
262, They said nothing regarding…	,d
263, Which one?	,q
264, The ones that Oleg suggested. Twenty-eight twenty-one and thirteen sixteen. They didn’t say anything.	,s
265," Yeah, what did they say?"	,q
266," I suggested to them, but…"	,d
267, They haven’t yet logged in.	,s
268," We’ve checked eighteen one, right? It doesn’t work?"	,q
269, What?	,q
270, Eighteen one.	,s
271," They said they are still holding on for eighteen one, hoping that it works, but you said 97% water loss there, right?"	,q
272," I mean, you end up with like …where is it? Like twelve thousand left. I mean, it’s not…"	,d
273, Twelve thousand…	,d
274, Liters left. And that’s just from after the loss. But then you have to filter it.	,s
275, Thirty-eight thirty-five.	,s
276, Thirty-eight thirty-five…100% water loss.	,s
277, Check six six.	,s
278, No water.	,s
279, And does the temperature of the sand or soil affect things for someone?	,q
280, What?	,q
281, Temperature. Is there such a parameter?	,q
282," Perhaps, there is but…Yes, there is that one."	,s
283, Soil temperature.	,s
284," Yes, there is that here, but not…"	,d
285, Doesn’t impact things?	,q
286, Yes.	,b
287, Блин!	,d
288, What about twelve fourteen? Twelve fourteen?	,q
289, What do you think of this one?	,q
290, Twelve fourteen.	,s
291, Hm?	,q
292, Thirteen fourteen.	,s
293, Twelve fourteen.	,s
294, Twelve?	,q
295, Yeah.	,b
296, What about thirteen fourteen?	,q
297, Do you want me to check that?	,q
298, Did you get any response from them regarding the…	,d
299, No.	,s
300, The points we suggested?	,q
301, Yeah.	,b
302, No. They seem to be ignoring us.	,s
303, Yeah.	,b
304," I mean, let’s let them. If they want to hunt, they’re gonna hunt. I mean…"	,d
305, It’s okay for me.	,s
306, Which?	,q
307, Twelve…twelve…	,d
308, Twelve fourteen?	,s
309, Yes.	,b
310," Will, will. What do you think? //Twelve fourteen."	,q
311, //Twelve fourteen.	,s
312," //Oleg, twelve fourteen?"	,q
313, //And thirteen fourteen.	,s
314," All in all, not too bad."	,s
315, They said: // “Our team…	,d
316, //No water.	,s
317," Oh, never mind."	,s
318," “Our team, generally, they didn’t like thirteen sixteen or twenty-eight twenty-one.”"	,q
319," Thirteen fourteen, please."	,s
320, Thirteen fourteen.	,s
321, Yes.	,b
322, Very good.	,b
323, Yes?	,q
324, Yes.	,b
325, No way!	,b
326, Yeah.	,b
327, Thank you.	,s
328, Wow! One point away from mine.	,f
329," Which point, Vika?"	,q
330, Thirteen fourteen. Please check thirteen fourteen.	,s
331, Ok. I will now work on the questions…	,d
332, Yes.	,b
333," Ash, what about you?"	,q
334," Oh, sorry. I had the survey questions so, I forgot."	,s
335," Oh, sure."	,s
336," It’s pretty good for me, actually. Yours too?"	,q
337, Yep.	,b
338, Just a second.	,f
339, [SL] Will you respond?	,q
340, Thirteen fourteen?	,q
341, Yes.	,b
342, I think yes. Good.	,s
343, [UI]	,d
344," [SL] Okay, we will keep this one. Excellent."	,s
345, Cool. And I have only just started…	,d
346, What other points did we like?	,q
347, Twenty-eight twenty-one and //thirteen sixteen.	,s
348, //What?	,q
349, What?	,q
350, It was like a mega one.	,s
351, In my isolation? One more time?	,q
352, Twenty-eight twenty-one.	,s
353, One. Again.	,s
354," Thirteen sixteen and thirteen fourteen – that one that you said…For me, all three of these points are with only minimal water loss."	,s
355, Have they written anything to anybody? Is there any reaction?	,q
356," Yes, one of my team is writing to me."	,s
357, Twenty-eight twenty-one?	,q
358, Only the meteorologist is writing to me.	,s
359, Twenty-eight twenty-one?	,q
360," Yeah, that’s the one that we took before."	,s
361, Yeah.	,b
362, It was the first one.	,s
363, Yeah.	,b
364, The perfect.	,s
365," Yeah, yeah. They didn’t like it."	,s
366, Terrain specialist…	,s
367, They didn’t like it?	,q
368, Mm-mm.	,b
369, Even sixteen…even thirteen sixteen.	,s
370," Oh, okay."	,b
371," Wait, what?"	,q
372, Thirteen sixteen and twenty-eight twenty-one.	,s
373, You mean thirteen fourteen?	,q
374," No, // thirteen sixteen was the first point that we gave them."	,s
375, //This is different.	,s
376," Oh, I see, I see. Okay."	,b
377," But thirteen fourteen, I hope they get back to us about."	,s
378, Why your team is keeping silence?	,q
379, Excuse me. The Martian terrain specialist is talking to me.	,s
380, Oh. Wow!	,b
381, Don’t be hating on my team.	,s
382," Congrats! They said: “Okay, that’s fine.” Thirteen fourteen."	,s
383, Thirteen fourteen?	,q
384, Yeah.	,b
385, [SL] We need to be finishing already.	,s
386," Okay. Forty-six, forty-three."	,s
387, A new one?	,q
388, Forty-six forty-three is passable.	,s
389, They suggested that one?	,q
390, But just…	,d
391, Forty or thirty?	,q
392," Forty-six – forty-six, forty-three. It’s got a lot of water loss, but it’s got an awful lot available."	,s
393," Forty-six forty-three, right?"	,q
394, Yes. It’s okay for me.	,s
395," It’s bad for me. Bad, bad, bad."	,s
396," Oh, wait, I am looking at my point. Oh, God. Look, who is such a Narcissus."	,s
397, //So good for us!	,s
398, //Now bad. It’s too deep. I think it will be too expensive for Salik to extract this water.	,s
399," Salah can pay for everything, right?"	,q
400, Huh?	,b
401," It’s okay, I am speaking for you."	,s
402, Why are you doing that?	,q
403, Forty-six forty-three.	,s
404," Which point are you looking at, guys?"	,q
405, Forty-six forty-three.	,s
406, It’s a big “eh” for me.	,s
407, Forty-six forty-three. Who said this one?	,q
408, They did.	,s
409, Big “X”.	,s
410, Big “X” for me too.	,s
411, Immediately not.	,s
412, Immediately not! Listen.	,f
413, Immediately.	,s
414," Forty…they like forty-six forty-three. So, forty-six forty-three…"	,d
415, I didn’t like it.	,s
416, It’s pretty bad for us.	,s
417, //I didn’t like it.	,s
418, //Three times as deep.	,s
419, What happened to them liking thirteen fourteen?	,q
420, Yes!	,f
421," Thirteen fourteen? Operation and drilling, they said it’s fine for them."	,q
422, Thirty-six thirty-two.	,s
423, Which one?	,q
424, Thirteen fourteen.	,s
425," Ah, forty-six forty-two, yeah, that’s…"	,d
426," We agreed, yeah, with drilling and operation specialist. They said, that’s fine."	,s
427," Yeah, because they just suggested…"	,d
428, Forty-six thirty-two?	,q
429, Forty-six thirty-two.	,b
430, It’s still pretty bad compared to the others.	,s
431, It’s okay for me.	,s
432, Six…	,s
433," Excuse me, but…"	,f
434, Fine.	,b
435, Fine.	,b
436, It’s pretty…it’s a lot of water.	,s
437, Okay. I guess I can make it work.	,s
438," Salya, it is good for you."	,q
439, More than previous points. Thirteen fourteen…	,s
440, Forty-six thirty-two is just decent.	,q
441, I like thirteen fourteen.	,s
442, [UI]	,d
443, Should I tell them it’s decent?	,q
444, Yeah.	,b
445, Is forty-six thirty-two good for everyone?	,q
446, Yes.	,b
447, Huh?	,b
448, Forty-six thirty-two was okay for you? No?	,q
449," Big NO, but…"	,d
450," No, no. Another one. //Forty-six thirty-two."	,s
451, //Forty-sox thirty-two.	,b
452, Thirty-two? Oh okay.	,q
453, Yes.	,b
454, Yeah. It’s okay.	,b
455, Des…	,d
456, Decent.	,b
