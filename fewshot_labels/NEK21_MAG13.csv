229," They said, thirty-one thirty is okay for them.",s
230, Yeah.,b
231, Yeah.,b
232," That’s what I’m saying. So, I told them: “Our preference is thirty-seven thirteen right now because it just has so much more water, but we are open to other candidates including thirty-one thirty.”",s
233, They wrote about thirty-seven thirteen - “isn’t great.”,s
234," Right. //And I said…I said that it has a lot of water, so.",s

272, Yeah.,b
273, For them – no.,s
274, That’s not our problem.,s
275, I see.,b
276," But, actually it’s our problem, yeah.",s
277," Yes, it is, not only from…from one person. Everyone is now saying, like, thirty-one thirteen. Everyone is starting to say, “thirty-one thirty”. It’s not just the one person.",s
278," Well, 60% loss.",s
279," Yes. Well, there’s a lot of water there. So, it’s like…",d

309, Okay.,b
310, Not bad for me.,s
311," Again, which one?",q
312, Thirty-seven thirty-five.,s
313, Did we look up…,d

317, //I want correlation…,d
318, //It’s okay for me.,s
319, Twelve thirty-one? No.,s

326, You’re literally reaching…,d
327, Thirty-one? Twelve thirty-one?,q
328," Mhm. That’s what they said, but they both suck for me. Like, you are reaching basically zero population.",s
329," Ah, okay. Well, then say that.",s
330, It’s okay.,s
331," And then, for thirteen thirty-one? How was that?",q
332, Both are pretty…,d

337, They say thirty-seven thirteen is their worst...,d
338, The worst option.,s
339, The worst case for them.,s
