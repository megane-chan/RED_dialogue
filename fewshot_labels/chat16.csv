0,Sedimentologist: WHAT'S UP Y'ALL IT'S TIME TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS @ 14:24\n
1,WHAT'S UP HOME SLICE ARE YOU READY TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS TO MAKE SOME WELLS ON MARS!? 14:25
2,"Also, we saw y'all's video. What's poppin that was cool"
3,Sedimentologist: Real talk we saw y'all's video but I didn't see you @structgeo\n
4,WHAT'S UP DRILL!? LETSGOOOOO 14:34
5,Hydrogeologist: Helloooooooooo!!!
6,Martian Meteorology Specialist: Hey y'all! Moscow is in the house!
7,Martian Meteorology Specialist: Hey y'all! Moscow is in the house!
8,Martian Meteorology Specialist: Hey y'all! Moscow is in the house!
9,Martian Meteorology Specialist: Hey y'all! Moscow is in the house!

14,Hydrogeologist: ??????????!
15,"Materials Specialist: we recommend (13,16) and (25,21) "
16,????? ?
17,Drilling Specialist: We have arrived
18,"Martian Meteorology Specialist: We would already like to suggest two points.  The first is (28,21) and the second is (13,16)"
19,what's crackalackin
20,we are finally here
21,Structural Geologist: 6:37 HAHAHAHHAHAH uhhhhhhh I think i forgot to send a video in LMAO
22,Structural Geologist: 6:37 WE HERE NOW
23,Structural Geologist: 6:38 Hola senores
24,Structural Geologist: 6:38 estamos aqui!\n
25,"Drilling Specialist: Looking at 18, 3"
26,Hydrogeologist: ?????
27,Ayyyyy just my knees and back tbh. I need to see a chiropractor prolly.
28,"Awesome, good to have y'all. We have that one point rn 13, 16 and it's dece from our end"
29,Sedimentologist: Hahahah large rip
30,Sedimentologist: WADDUP LARGE HELLO FROM OUR END
31,Operations Specialist: chicago vibes have arrived B)
32,"Materials Specialist: and (28,21)"
33,"Sedimentologist: 100% water loss on 18, 3. Sad tbh."
34,"we are now consideringg 18,1 it works pretty good for us\n"
35,Hydrogeologist: So when you send your video?))
36,"Martian Terrain Specialist: 18,1 seems like a good option"
37,"Structural Geologist: 6:44 we're looking at (18,1)!!!!!\n"
38,"18, 3 has 100% water loss FYI"
39,"Materials Specialist: no water in 18,3 and also it's too deep"
40,"18, 3 has 100% water loss FYI"
41,"Sedimentologist: 18, 3 has 100% water loss FYI"
42,Martian Meteorology Specialist: Hey - Are you there??? :)
43,Martian Meteorology Specialist: Worddd up!\n
44,"Martian Meteorology Specialist: We're looking at (28,21) and (13,16)!!!"
45,"Martian Meteorology Specialist: We're looking at (28,21) and (13,16)!!!"
46,"Martian Meteorology Specialist: We're looking at (28,21) and (13,16)!!!"
47,Operations Specialist: lol
48,"Hi, we started/ 18,21  13,16"
49,"Hi, we started/ 18,21  13,16"
50,"18, 1 has 97% water loss"
51,"Sedimentologist: 18, 1 has 97% water loss tho sad day"
52,"Yikes, uh can y'all check anything in that same grid area from 16, 6 to 20, 1"
53,"Operations Specialist: hello, noted"
54,"Materials Specialist: what do you think about (13,16) and 28,21) ??"
55,"Operations Specialist: anything in the lower left corner seems to be good for me and the drilling specialist, so are there any points there that vibe?"
56,"Sedimentologist: (18, 01) - 97% water loss, 412479.42 available, ?12,374.3826? after loss"
57,"Martian Terrain Specialist: We're all here! Still hoping for 18,1 lol"
58,Materials Specialist: we are waiting your reply
59,"(18, 01) - 97% water loss, 412479.42 available, ?12,374.3826? after loss"
60,"Structural Geologist: 6:50 ok how abou 18,1????\n"
61,"Sedimentologist: (18, 01) - 97% water loss, 412479.42 available, ?12,374.3826? after loss"
62,"Martian Meteorology Specialist: I personally like 18,1, as there's a large population reached and has decently high accessibility, but our sedimentologist said that there's 97% water loss there.  Did you all look at the two points I mentioned by any chance?"
63,Structural Geologist: 6:50 @hydro IDK when we send again :((
64,ok
65,"does 19,2 work???"
66,wait it probably has water loss too
67,"Structural Geologist: 6:51 how about 19,2?????1?!?"
68,Ye brb
69,"16, 06 - 100% water loss and no water"
70,"Operations Specialist: our team generally did not like 13,16 or 28,21"
71,"(20, 01) - 96% loss, 399034.75 available, ?15,961.36? after loss"
72,"Martian Meteorology Specialist: sedimentologist says that with the 97% water loss there, you are left with about 12000 liters at that point, and that's before filtering it. So, while I like that point A LOT, our sedimentologist isn't liking it that much. "
73,Martian Meteorology Specialist: btw- NASA finally sent us the group video that you all made for us! :) we loved it!
74,96% water loss sad day
75,Hydrogeologist: It's ok you can send us separately! :P
76,Materials Specialist: most points in that area doesn't have water as per sidmentolgist 
77,"(19, 02) - 96% loss, 348090.96 available, ?13,923.6384? after loss"
78,Martian Terrain Specialist: Yeah apparently there are several problems with those on our end
79,"(13, 14) - 61% loss, 314237 available, ?122,552.43? after loss"
80,"Martian Meteorology Specialist: So, another point that's looking might fine for us is (13,14)"
81,"Sedimentologist: (13, 14) - 61% loss, 314237 available, ?122,552.43? after loss"
82,"Materials Specialist: no problem, we really liked 13,14"
83,"Martian Meteorology Specialist: So, another point that's looking might fine for us is (13,14)"
84,"Operations Specialist: ok, that's fine"
85,"Sedimentologist: 13, 14 is prob the best from our end so far"
86,"Sedimentologist: (13, 14) - 61% loss, 314237 available, ?122,552.43? after loss"
87,"Martian Meteorology Specialist: (13,14) is looking pretty nice for us!"
88,"13,14"
89,"4, 4 is looking interesting to us"
90,Sedimentologist: Big water here tbh
91,Hydrogeologist: What about 13*14?\n
92,"(13, 14) - 61% loss, 314237 available, ?122,552.43? after loss"
93,"13,14"
94,"currently look at 46,32 and 48,30"
95,"Sedimentologist: (19, 02) - 96% loss, 348090.96 available, ?13,923.6384? after loss"
96,Hydrogeologist: And what do you think about 28*21 aaaand 13*16? 
97,"Sedimentologist: (18, 01) - 97% water loss, 412479.42 available, ?12,374.3826? after loss"
98,"we like 46,32"
99,"Can you try 46,32\n"
100,"Martian Terrain Specialist: 46,32 is looking ok for our team"
101,"13, 14 is really our mega one"
102,"Structural Geologist: 7:02 uhhhhh 46,32????"
103,94% water loss sad day
104,"Operations Specialist: some of us like it, but it's bad for the mechanical engineer"
105,Materials Specialist: That's great ??????
106,water depth under 900 seems to have worst total water input \n
107,"(46, 43) - 87% loss, 345982.62 available, ?44,977.7406? after loss"
108,"Operations Specialist: 13,14 is fine for some of us, but it's pretty bad for the mechanical engineer"
109,Dece I think but other people haven't weighed in yet
110,"Materials Specialist: So let's finalize with (13,14)"
111,"48, 43 has 96% loss sad"
112,"(48, 43) - 96% loss, 317288.68 available, ?12,691.5472? after loss"
113,"46, 43 is pretty bad on our end but it does have some sense of water."
114,"Sedimentologist: (48, 43) - 96% loss, 317288.68 available, ?12,691.5472? after loss"
115,"Structural Geologist: 7:06 not 28,21 only 51k water available"
116,"Sedimentologist: (46, 32) - 59% loss, ?293080.31 available, 120,162.9271? after loss"
117,Sedimentologist: Looks dece to us
118,"10% loss, very good\n"
119,"13,16 imight be fine\n"
120,"(46, 32) - 59% loss, ?293080.31 available, 120,162.9271? after loss"
121,"Martian Meteorology Specialist: Ok, that one is decent for us actually, we could go for that one. "
122,"Martian Meteorology Specialist: Ok, that one is decent for us actually, we could go for that one. "
123,"Martian Meteorology Specialist: Ok, that one is decent for us actually, we could go for that one. "
124,"46, 32 - looks dece on our end."
125,"(46, 32) - 59% loss, ?293080.31 available, 120,162.9271? after loss"
126,"Sedimentologist: (46, 32) - 59% loss, ?293080.31 available, 120,162.9271? after loss"
127,Sedimentologist: Is a go from our end FYI
128,"Martian Meteorology Specialist: gotcha. like how bad are we talking? Another point the martian terrain specialist mentioned to us was 46, 32 and that one is decent for us, as well.\n"
129,"Operations Specialist: I think we're considering 13,16 now"
130,Operations Specialist: cause it works
131,"Structural Geologist: 7:09 we trying 13,16."
132,"Mechanical Engineer: (13,16)?"
133,"either 46,32 or 13,16 is fine for us\n"
134,"Structural Geologist: 7:10 ok we could do either 46,32 or 13,16 on our end. leaning towards 46,32"
135,"I think people like 46,32 better"
136,awesome!
137,"We loaded the point in but if y'all want to change it, go for it."
138,"Sedimentologist: We loaded the point in but if y'all want to change it, go for it."
139,"Structural Geologist: 7:11 ok if yall are cool with it lets just do 46,32!!!!"
140,Keep it real
141,Anyone missing today?
142,Sedimentologist: LETSGOOOOO
143,Sedimentologist: Let us know if anyone is missing today
144,"Sedimentologist: Otherwise, catch y'all in the relay!"
