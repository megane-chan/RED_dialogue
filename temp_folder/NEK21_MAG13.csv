178,Oleg," Will, if you were playing alone, you would still manage to win.",0,13
179,Will," Yes, yes.",0,13

181,Will," //I like it! Yes, yes.",0,13
182,Will," I don’t quite understand why they have water loss. I mean, it affects that, but not quite so much.",0,13
183,Will," Well, in general…",0,13
184,Oleg, There are very few sources of water.,0,13
185,Will," Yes. That is, you will remove it and there will be no more.",0,13
186,Ashley, Oh! Somebody has responded.,0,13
187,Oleg," Now, in fact…",0,13
188,Ashley," So they’ll say they don’t have the operations specialist and the maintenance specialist yet, but they’ll continue without them. Hold on.",0,13

198,Ashley, No. Human factors I have.,0,13
199,Vika, [SL] Oh! I’m sorry.,0,13
200,Ashley," How do you say: “I’m always late”? Okay, like, 50% of the time.",0,13
201,Vika, Let’s concentrate on the task. Okay?,0,13
202,Will, They are saying that thirty-one thirty is better for the geologist.,0,13
203,Oleg, //Thirty-one thirty?,0,13
204,Ashley, //Did they say why?,0,13
205,Salah, They said what?,0,13

209,Ashley, Was it only for one person…,0,13
210,Will," Yes, for now.",0,13

213,Oleg, //If we enter here…,0,13
214,Ashley," //Yes, for me too.",0,13
215,Oleg, Sixty…it’s okay…[UI],0,13
216,Ashley," According to my chart, that would be part of the worst options. Doable but the worst.",0,13
217,Oleg, [UI] sixty…sixty here.,0,13
218,Vika, I’d like some coffee. Darn!,0,13
219,Oleg," Well, it’s definitely 60% loss.",0,13
220,Ashley," And only ten in the other one, right? At thirty-seven thirteen.",0,13
221,Oleg," Yes, thirty-seven thirteen – it’s really great.",0,13
222,Will, Darn!,0,13
223,Oleg," We didn’t even consider. Well, what? I have thirty-one thirty marked, but…",0,13
224,Vika," Hey, Will.",0,13
225,Will, Hm?,0,13
226,Vika," Ah, we have. Well, okay. I see what we have.",0,13
227,Will, Why are you starting?,0,13

229,Salah," They said, thirty-one thirty is okay for them.",0,13
230,Will, Yeah.,0,13
231,Ashley, Yeah.,0,13
232,Will," That’s what I’m saying. So, I told them: “Our preference is thirty-seven thirteen right now because it just has so much more water, but we are open to other candidates including thirty-one thirty.”",0,13
233,Salah, They wrote about thirty-seven thirteen - “isn’t great.”,0,13
234,Will," Right. //And I said…I said that it has a lot of water, so.",0,13
235,Ashley, //Did they say why and how many people?,0,13
236,Vika, Sixteen seventeen?,1,13
237,Will, From them?,1,13
238,Vika, No.,1,13
239,Oleg, No water.,1,13
240,Will, You are right.,1,13
241,Oleg, Why are you looking at this point? The water is so dirty there.,1,13
242,Vika, Not dirtier than in other spots.,1,13
243,Oleg," Well, thirty-seven thirteen – it’s not bad.",1,13
244,Oleg, I just don’t understand why they are not tied to the landscape? [SL] for the aquifer.,1,13
245,Will, It’s so strange to see your veins after so many years.,1,13
246,Vika, What do you mean?,1,13
247,Ashley," Were you that fat that you didn’t, see? //I’m just kidding.",1,13
248,Will," //No, I did not see. You’re right. But it was there.",1,13
249,Ashley, Was it really because of the chubbiness?,1,13
250,Will," Yeah, absolutely! Now I can see my veins.",1,13
251,Vika," Oh! Oh, really?",1,13
252,Will," Now I’m, like, back to looking like I was when I was younger.",1,13
253,Ashley, Ew…,1,13

256,Ashley, Darn!,1,13

259,Vika, Darn!,1,13
260,Salah:,"  Mechanical engineer, he said that thirty-one thirty is the best point for them.",1,13
261,Will," Okay. I mean, it can be used for us, I think.",1,13
262,Ashley," It’s, like, pretty bad.",1,13
263,Will," It’s on the border, but.",1,13
264,Ashley, It’s pretty bad.,1,13
265,Will," //I mean, if they are all…they are saying it is really good, so…",1,13
266,Vika, //Which one?,1,13
267,Ashley, //For me.,1,13
268,Vika, //Which one? Which one?,1,13
269,Ashley, Thirty-one thirty.,1,13
270,Vika," Oh, okay. But the best point, I mean now…for now it’s thirty-seven thirteen.",1,13
271,Salah," Yeah, for us.",1,13
272,Vika, Yeah.,1,13
273,Salah, For them – no.,1,13
274,Vika, That’s not our problem.,1,13
275,Salah, I see.,1,13
276,Vika," But, actually it’s our problem, yeah.",1,13
277,Will," Yes, it is, not only from…from one person. Everyone is now saying, like, thirty-one thirteen. Everyone is starting to say, “thirty-one thirty”. It’s not just the one person.",1,13
278,Oleg," Well, 60% loss.",1,13
279,Will," Yes. Well, there’s a lot of water there. So, it’s like…",1,13
280,Ashley," Doesn’t reach a very high population, though.",1,13
281,Ashley, And that sucks.,1,13
282,Vika, Darn!,1,13
283,Ashley, For future sustainability.,1,13
284,Salah, They are looking on nineteen thirty-six and thirteen thirty-one.,1,13
285,Ashley, Nineteen thirty-six.,1,13
286,Salah, Thirty-six.,1,13
287,Will, 95% water loss at nineteen thirty-six.,1,13
288,Ashley," //Well, that looks awful.",1,13
289,Salah, //And thirteen thirty-one.,1,13
290,Will, Which one?,1,13
291,Salah, Thirteen thirty-one.,1,13
292,Will, Let me see.,1,13
293,Oleg, [UI].,1,13
294,Ashley, Awful. Both of those are awful for me.,1,13
295,Salah, Both of them. Yeah.,1,13
296,Vika, For me it’s okay.,1,13
297,Will," Oh, I knew it had to happen. Okay.",1,13
298,Will," Okay. What was the other one, Salah?",1,13
299,Salah, They suggested?,1,13
300,Will, Yeah.,1,13
301,Salah, Thirteen thirty-one.,1,13
302,Will, That one is not bad.,1,13
303,Oleg, Mhm.,1,13
304,Oleg, Take a look at thirty-seven thirty-five.,1,13
305,Will, Hold on.,1,13
306,Oleg, Not too bad at all.,1,13
307,Ashley, What did you…which one did you say?,1,13
308,Oleg," Thirty-seven thirty-five, but it seems to me that there’s no water there because the ground temperature is high.",1,13
309,Will, Okay.,1,13
310,Ashley, Not bad for me.,1,13
311,Vika," Again, which one?",1,13
312,Oleg, Thirty-seven thirty-five.,1,13
313,Ashley, Did we look up…,1,13
314,Ashley," Mechanical engineer here is writing, twelve thirty-one and thirteen thirty-one. //Did we look at those?",1,13
315,Will," //Yeah, thirteen thirty-one is very good. The other one is not.",1,13
316,Ashley, Are you sure thirteen thirty-one…//You did twelve thirty-one as well?,1,13
317,Oleg, //I want correlation…,1,13
318,Vika, //It’s okay for me.,1,13
319,Will, Twelve thirty-one? No.,1,13
320,Ashley, The one you said is not bad for me.,1,13

322,Oleg," Will, and for you?",1,13
323,Will," Hold on, hold on. Twelve thirty-one.",1,13
324,Ashley, Twelve thirty-one and thirteen thirty-one freaking suck for me.,1,13
325,Will," Twelve thirty-one is pretty good too, actually.",1,13
326,Ashley, You’re literally reaching…,1,13
327,Vika, Thirty-one? Twelve thirty-one?,1,13
328,Ashley," Mhm. That’s what they said, but they both suck for me. Like, you are reaching basically zero population.",1,13
329,Will," Ah, okay. Well, then say that.",1,13
330,Vika, It’s okay.,1,13
331,Will," And then, for thirteen thirty-one? How was that?",1,13
332,Ashley, Both are pretty…,1,13
333,Will, Both are bad? Okay.,1,13
334,Ashley, Pretty bad population-wise.,1,13
335,Ashley, I like how  thirty-seven thirteen was their worst point so far.,1,13
336,Vika, Huh?,1,13
337,Ashley, They say thirty-seven thirteen is their worst...,1,13
338,Vika, The worst option.,1,13
339,Ashley, The worst case for them.,1,13
340,Vika, Sucks.,1,13
341,Oleg," Yes. They are comparing with thirty-one thirty, which doesn’t work for us at all.",1,13
342,Vika," Sorry, Ash.",1,13
343,Ashley, My team is not responding at all. I’m just talking to the engineering team. I’m not even there.,1,13
344,Oleg, The mechanic to you…,1,13
345,Ashley, Yes.,1,13
346,Vika, Oh!,1,13
347,Ashley," I just saw your response, Will. [SL] Give me a second.",1,13

350,Ashley, You said thirty-seven thirty-five earlier.,1,13
351,Vika, No. Not thirty-seven thirty-five.,1,13
352,Oleg, Thirty-one thirty.,1,13
353,Vika, Thirty-one thirty-five – old point. [SL],1,13

361,Oleg," No, the water was clean there.",1,13
362,Ashley, [singing],1,13
363,Vika, Darn!,1,13
364,Oleg," I wonder, why are we not working on an assignment where we should study the lunar surface?",1,13
365,Will, Because rocks fly off there.,1,13
366,Vika, A rock that doesn’t fly off the //lunar surface.,1,13
367,Ashley, //What do you think of forty-two thirteen?,1,13
368,Oleg, It was part of the previous game.,1,13
369,Will, Thirteen?,1,13
370,Ashley, Forty-two thirteen.,1,13
371,Oleg, There’s no water there.,1,13
372,Will," Yes, there is only little there, but it’s enough to…",1,13
373,Vika, Have a drink.,1,13
374,Will, “Thirty-one thirty is our worst option”,1,13
375,Vika, Sorry. No. Because it’s high level of contamination.,1,13
376,Oleg, Okay. It’s so dirty there that…,1,13
377,Ashley, Okay! Okay!,1,13
378,Will, Just like you!,1,13
379,Vika, Easy!,1,13
380,Ashley, Understand all the sides.,1,13
381,Will," I mean, that was okay for me. But it’s not…",1,13
382,Oleg," It’s not water there, it’s just mud.",1,13

442,Oleg," In terms of water availability, is it confirmed or not?",1,13
443,Will, What?,1,13
444,Oleg," Twenty-nine …twenty-nine thirty-three. Does the algorithm work or not? Water and sand are colder... Well, the temperature of the sand...",1,13

446,Salah, //Twenty-nine …,1,13
447,Ashley, //Twenty-nine thirty-three.,1,13
448,Oleg," Mhm. Well, it is already…",1,13
449,Ashley, So what now? Shall we say then we can do thirty-one thirty?,1,13
450,Will," Yes. If they agree, yes. Just…",1,13
451,Oleg, But losses will be great.,1,13
452,Salah," Mechanical engineer said, thirty-one thirty and nineteen thirty-six, I think.",1,13
453,Ashley, If it’s between those two…,1,13
454,Salah, Yeah.,1,13
