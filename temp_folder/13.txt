Ashley: Okay. Today is April 5th, 2022. It is mission day 152. The time is 2:30PM. Three, two, one. //Mark.

All://Mark. 

Will: Let’s get down to business. 

Vika: Darn! 

00:00:31:01 – 00:01:14:02 

[no audio]

Vika: It’s not working for me again. Is it working for everyone?

Ashley: Mhm. 

Will: What is it, is there a problem?

Vika: It seems so. Okay. Maybe, I should log in again?

Will: Give it time. 

Vika: Huh?

Salah: Check eleven forty-one. 

00:01:47:95

Ashley: Really bad for me. 

Salah: Huh?

Will: No water. 

Vika: Oh. 

Salah: Okay. 

Ashley: Can I suggest thirty-seven thirteen?

Vika: No, sorry. 

Ashley: Thirty-seven thirteen.

Will: Not bad. Not bad. Really good actually. 

Ashley: Actually. Is thirty-seven twelve any better for you?

Will: Probably not, but let me check. 

00:02:19: 00

Vika: For me…

Will: No water. 

Vika: It would be better, but //it’s okay. 

Ashley: //Okay. So, thirty-seven eleven was good, right? Or…wait, what did I say first?

Will: Thirty-seven thirteen.

Ashley: Thirteen. 

Salah: Thirteen 

Ashley: So, there is water at thirty-seven thirteen.

Will: Mhm.

Ashley: And for everyone else?

Vika: It’s okay. 

Ashley: Oh.

Vika: It’s not the best. 

Ashley: But, maybe.

Vika: Well, maybe. In fact, why not, right? And, let’s wrap it up then. 

Ashley: How about you?

00:02:46:04

Oleg: I’ll tell you now. Well, possible. It’s borderline. Borderline. 

Ashley: Okay. Okay. 

Will: There’s a lot of water.

Ashley: Ho-ho-ho.

Will: So…

Oleg: Well, there will be 10% loss. 

Will: It’s very little, if…

00:03:15:00

Vika: Thirty-nine twenty-eight. Thirty-nine twenty-eight. 

Will: [SL] One sec. 

Ashley: Not bad. Not bad. 

Oleg: 30% losses.

Will: Which one? Which one?

Vika: Thirty-nine twenty-eight. For you?

Ashley: //30% losses.

Will: No water. 
 
00:03:44:27

Ashley: No water. Okay. So, for now still thirty-seven thirteen.

Oleg: We keep thirty-seven thirteen.

Ashley: Mhm. 

Salah: Thirty-one thirty?

Ashley: Not the best for me. 

Will: It’s okay for me.

00:04:15:27

Will: It’s actually a pretty good one. 

Vika: Oleg, will you be able to filter it? Thirty-one thirty. 

Oleg: Hold on. 

Vika: The previous was…The first one was better. 

Will: It’s better for me too but…

Vika: [UI]

Oleg: Oh, they are playing now.

Salah: What happened?

Ashley: The lights…

Oleg: No, it’s 60% contamination. 

00:04:44:00

Ashley: Okay. So, thirty-seven thirteen is still the best. So maybe I should suggest it to my team?

Will: Me too.

Vika: Yeah, I think so. 

Oleg: [SL] Seventy-five

Vika: Hm.

Oleg: Thirty-one thirteen – is there a lot of water?

Will: Yes, it seems so. Eighty-eight thousand. 

00:05:17:03

Will: That’s not little.

Ashley: More than the other point?

Will: No. The other one – there’s a hundred and twenty-two there. 

Ashley: Oh-ho-ho.

Will: Thousand.

Oleg: 60% total. 

Vika: One twenty-two. Could you check please? One twenty-two.

Salah: Did you get any reply from them?

Ashley: Not yet. 

Will: Not yet. One twenty-two?

Vika: Yep. 

00:05:46:05

Will: You guessed.

Vika: No water?

Will: No water. 

Oleg: Darn. 

Ashley: Okay, I won’t look at it. 

Vika: Exactly. 

Will: Fuck. 

Vika: Darn! Everything is spoilt! 

Oleg: How about one one? 

Will: Hold on. 

Vika: We’ll look now. 

00:06:14:27

Ashley: Where is it? Ah, okay, here. 

Will: No water. 

Ashley: Okay. 

Vika: Well, okay, okay. 

00:06:30:05 – 00:07:21:17

[no audio]

Oleg: Why isn’t there absolutely clean water?

Ashley: Let’s see. 



00:07:50:04

Will: Does your family have any date trees?

Salah: Hm?

Will: Does your family have any date trees? Come on! Of course! 

Salah: It’s the normal. 

Will: There is… “What do you…what do you think of me? Do you think I don’t have any date trees?! Come on! What are you saying?”

Ashley: What are you looking at?

Oleg: What?

Ashley: Forty-nine.

Oleg: Forty-nine what?

Will: What?

Ashley: Forty. //Nine. 

Oleg: //Oh, forty forty-nine?

Ashley: And nine. 

00:08:20:00

Ashley: So, forty and nine. No? Nothing. Okay. 

Oleg: Darn!

Vika: Nice guy.

Ashley: Thank you. 

Salah: Twenty twenty-one?

Ashley: No! //Just kidding.

Vika: //Your turn. 
Ashley: Twenty…

Salah: Check.

Ashley: Twenty-one. It’s not great. Okay. No water, I think. 

00:08:58:06

Salah: Twelve thirty.

Will: Hold on. 

Oleg: What is it, have our partners decided not to contact us at all?

Will: Twelve?

Salah: Thirty. 

Ashley: Wow! Not good. Not sustainable for a colony. 

Will: No water. 

Oleg: The water is practically crystal clear. 

Will: Yes, because there’s none there.

Oleg: Wait. Still, take a look at it. Six fifty. 

Vika: Six.

Ashley: Six.

Will: Six fifty?

Oleg: Yes, I understand that 

00:09:29:27

Oleg: Salah will not like it, but…

Ashley: I don’t like it either. 

Will: There’s water, but high water loss. So, it’s the borderline, I would say. 

Salah: Too deep. 

Oleg: The water is very clean there. 

Will: Well, it’s not bad then. 

Salah: Fifteen forty-one?

Will: One second. 

00:10:01:20

Ashley: Which one did you suggest?

Salah: Fifteen forty-one. 

Ashley: Fifteen forty-one. …It’s not great either. 

Will: Fifteen forty-one you said?

Salah: Yes. 

Will: 100% water loss. 

00:10:37:15

Vika: Fuck. 

Ashley: Oops. 

Vika: Thirty-seven thirty-one. Can you check please guys?  Thirty-seven thirty-one. 

00:11:03:17

Will: No water. 

Ashley: It’s not bad for me, but…

Salah: Okay. 

Vika: Thirty-six thirty-one?

Ashley: Thirty-six…

00:11:31:10

Vika: Oh! Oh! Oh! Easy. 

Ashley: [SL] Where is it? Not bad. 

Vika: Okay, okay. 

Salah: Thirty-one forty-four. 

00:12:00:01

Salah: Thirty-one forty-four. 

Will: No water. 

Vika: Forty thirty-three. 

Ashley: Forty thirty-three. 

Oleg: It seems one can play this game.

Will: Which one?

Vika: Forty thirty-three. 

Ashley: Not the best. Not the worst. 

Will: Forty thirty-three. No water. 

00:12:30:15

Ashley: Okay. 

Oleg: Will, if you were playing alone, you would still manage to win.

Will: Yes, yes.

Oleg: Because//there is information about the availability of water…that is, no matter how clean the puddle is…if there is nothing there, there is no point in looking.

Will: //I like it! Yes, yes. 

Will: I don’t quite understand why they have water loss. I mean, it affects that, but not quite so much.

00:13:02:14

Will: Well, in general…

Oleg: There are very few sources of water.

Will: Yes. That is, you will remove it and there will be no more.

Ashley: Oh! Somebody has responded. 

Oleg: Now, in fact…

Ashley: So they’ll say they don’t have the operations specialist and the maintenance specialist yet, but they’ll continue without them. Hold on. 

Vika: They haven’t woken up yet. 

00:13:30:08

Ashley: It’s very early there. 

Vika: It’s so difficult, waking up, yes?

Ashley: Oh, operations specialist just arrived, they are saying here. Well, they carry on anyway. Cool.

Vika: Poor guys. 

Ashley: Maintenance specialist? That’s on my team.

Will: Hm?

00:14:00:00

Ashley: They said that the maintenance specialist still hasn’t come. That’s on my team.

Vika: Because…you mean, because he is late?

Ashley: No. Human factors I have. 

Vika: [SL] Oh! I’m sorry.
Ashley: How do you say: “I’m always late”? Okay, like, 50% of the time. 

00:14:32:15

Vika: Let’s concentrate on the task. Okay?

Will: They are saying that thirty-one thirty is better for the geologist. 

Oleg: //Thirty-one thirty?

Ashley: //Did they say why?

Salah: They said what?

Will: When we checked…thirty-one thirty, they are saying that they are looking more at that one right now. 

Oleg: It is, in general, 60% loss. 

Vika: And water is dirty. 

00:15:01:25

Ashley: Was it only for one person…

Will: Yes, for now. 

Ashley: Because if it is for everyone else //better in the other…

Vika: //Thirty-seven thirteen is much better.

Oleg: //If we enter here…

Ashley: //Yes, for me too.

Oleg: Sixty…it’s okay…[UI]

Ashley: According to my chart, that would be part of the worst options. Doable but the worst.

00:15:30:05

Oleg: [UI] sixty…sixty here.

Vika: I’d like some coffee. Darn!
Oleg: Well, it’s definitely 60% loss. 

Ashley: And only ten in the other one, right? At thirty-seven thirteen.

Oleg: Yes, thirty-seven thirteen – it’s really great. 

00:16:03:27

Will: Darn! 

Oleg: We didn’t even consider. Well, what? I have thirty-one thirty marked, but…

Vika: Hey, Will.

Will: Hm?

Vika: Ah, we have. Well, okay. I see what we have. 

Will: Why are you starting?

Vika: Okay, okay. We were communicating just fine. Oops. 

Salah: They said, thirty-one thirty is okay for them. 

00:16:31:22

Will: Yeah. 

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: That’s what I’m saying. So, I told them: “Our preference is thirty-seven thirteen right now because it just has so much more water, but we are open to other candidates including thirty-one thirty.”

Salah: They wrote about thirty-seven thirteen - “isn’t great.”

Will: Right. //And I said…I said that it has a lot of water, so.

Ashley: //Did they say why and how many people?

00:16:59:01 – 00:17:21:27

[no audio]

Vika: Sixteen seventeen?

Will: From them?

Vika: No.

Oleg: No water. 

Will: You are right. 

Oleg: Why are you looking at this point? The water is so dirty there. 

Vika: Not dirtier than in other spots. 

Oleg: Well, thirty-seven thirteen – it’s not bad. 

00:17:56:00

Oleg: I just don’t understand why they are not tied to the landscape? [SL] for the aquifer.

Will: It’s so strange to see your veins after so many years.

Vika: What do you mean?

Ashley: Were you that fat that you didn’t, see? //I’m just kidding.

Will: //No, I did not see. You’re right. But it was there.

Ashley: Was it really because of the chubbiness?

Will: Yeah, absolutely! Now I can see my veins.

Vika: Oh! Oh, really?

Will: Now I’m, like, back to looking like I was when I was younger.

Ashley: Ew…

Will: It’s like…

Vika: Darn!

Ashley: Darn!

Will: Darn!

00:18:28:03

Oleg: Now you’ll show it to a mosquito, and it will suck everything out of you.

Vika: Darn!

Salah:  Mechanical engineer, he said that thirty-one thirty is the best point for them. 

Will: Okay. I mean, it can be used for us, I think.

Ashley: It’s, like, pretty bad.

Will: It’s on the border, but. 

Ashley: It’s pretty bad. 

Will: //I mean, if they are all…they are saying it is really good, so…

Vika: //Which one?

Ashley: //For me.

Vika: //Which one? Which one?

Ashley: Thirty-one thirty. 

Vika: Oh, okay. But the best point, I mean now…for now it’s thirty-seven thirteen. 

Salah: Yeah, for us. 

Vika: Yeah. 

Salah: For them – no. 

Vika: That’s not our problem. 

Salah: I see. 

00:19:00:14

Vika: But, actually it’s our problem, yeah. 

Will: Yes, it is, not only from…from one person. Everyone is now saying, like, thirty-one thirteen. Everyone is starting to say, “thirty-one thirty”. It’s not just the one person. 

Oleg: Well, 60% loss. 

Will: Yes. Well, there’s a lot of water there. So, it’s like…

Ashley: Doesn’t reach a very high population, though. 

00:19:30:17

Ashley: And that sucks. 

Vika: Darn! 

Ashley: For future sustainability.

Salah: They are looking on nineteen thirty-six and thirteen thirty-one. 

Ashley: Nineteen thirty-six. 

Salah: Thirty-six. 

Will: 95% water loss at nineteen thirty-six. 

Ashley: //Well, that looks awful.

Salah: //And thirteen thirty-one. 

Will: Which one?

00:19:59:15

Salah: Thirteen thirty-one. 

Will: Let me see. 

Oleg: [UI].

Ashley: Awful. Both of those are awful for me. 

Salah: Both of them. Yeah. 

Vika: For me it’s okay. 

Will: Oh, I knew it had to happen. Okay. 

00:20:20:15 – 00:21:34:13

[no audio]

Will: Okay. What was the other one, Salah?

Salah: They suggested?

Will: Yeah. 

Salah: Thirteen thirty-one. 

Will: That one is not bad. 

Oleg: Mhm.

00:22:03:07

Oleg: Take a look at thirty-seven thirty-five. 

Will: Hold on. 

Oleg: Not too bad at all. 

Ashley: What did you…which one did you say?

Oleg: Thirty-seven thirty-five, but it seems to me that there’s no water there because the ground temperature is high. 

Will: Okay. 

Ashley: Not bad for me. 

Vika: Again, which one?

Oleg: Thirty-seven thirty-five.

Ashley: Did we look up…


00:22:31:07

Ashley: Mechanical engineer here is writing, twelve thirty-one and thirteen thirty-one. //Did we look at those?

Will: //Yeah, thirteen thirty-one is very good. The other one is not. 

Ashley: Are you sure thirteen thirty-one…//You did twelve thirty-one as well?

Oleg: //I want correlation…

Vika: //It’s okay for me. 

Will: Twelve thirty-one? No. 

Ashley: The one you said is not bad for me. 

Vika: For me too. 

Oleg: Will, and for you?

Will: Hold on, hold on. Twelve thirty-one. 

Ashley: Twelve thirty-one and thirteen thirty-one freaking suck for me. 

Will: Twelve thirty-one is pretty good too, actually. 

00:23:02:06

Ashley: You’re literally reaching…

Vika: Thirty-one? Twelve thirty-one?

Ashley: Mhm. That’s what they said, but they both suck for me. Like, you are reaching basically zero population. 

Will: Ah, okay. Well, then say that. 

Vika: It’s okay. 

Will: And then, for thirteen thirty-one? How was that?

Ashley: Both are pretty…

Will: Both are bad? Okay. 

Ashley: Pretty bad population-wise. 

00:23:49:05

Ashley: I like how  thirty-seven thirteen was their worst point so far. 

Vika: Huh?

Ashley: They say thirty-seven thirteen is their worst...

Vika: The worst option.

Ashley: The worst case for them. 

Vika: Sucks. 

Oleg: Yes. They are comparing with thirty-one thirty, which doesn’t work for us at all.

Vika: Sorry, Ash.

Ashley: My team is not responding at all. I’m just talking to the engineering team. I’m not even there.

00:24:27:17

Oleg: The mechanic to you…

Ashley: Yes. 

Vika: Oh! 

Ashley: I just saw your response, Will. [SL] Give me a second. 

00:25:09:01

Will: So, Oleg, did you say some point?

Oleg: Thirty-one…I already…hold on. Hold on.

Ashley: You said thirty-seven thirty-five earlier. 

Vika: No. Not thirty-seven thirty-five. 

Oleg: Thirty-one thirty. 

Vika: Thirty-one thirty-five – old point. [SL]

00:25:31:14

Oleg: I’ll enter it now…

Vika: Oops.

Ashley: Yeah, it is. 

Vika: Excuse me. 

Ashley: Thirty-one what?

Oleg: Can’t remember. Shoot, I…

Ashley: Perhaps, it wasn’t very good.

Oleg: No, the water was clean there.

00:26:01:12

Ashley: [singing]

Vika: Darn! 

Oleg: I wonder, why are we not working on an assignment where we should study the lunar surface?

Will: Because rocks fly off there. 

Vika: A rock that doesn’t fly off the //lunar surface.

Ashley: //What do you think of forty-two thirteen?

Oleg: It was part of the previous game. 

Will: Thirteen?

Ashley: Forty-two thirteen. 

00:26:30:24

Oleg: There’s no water there.
 
Will: Yes, there is only little there, but it’s enough to…

Vika: Have a drink. 

Will: “Thirty-one thirty is our worst option”

Vika: Sorry. No. Because it’s high level of contamination. 

Oleg: Okay. It’s so dirty there that…

Ashley: Okay! Okay!

Will: Just like you! 

Vika: Easy! 

Ashley: Understand all the sides. 

00:27:01:00

Will: I mean, that was okay for me. But it’s not…

Oleg: It’s not water there, it’s just mud. 

Ashley: To us drilling specialist says nineteen thirty-six is the best one for them.

Oleg: Nineteen thirty-six? 

Ashley: Yes. What was there for us?

Vika: Did we check nineteen thirty-six?

Ashley: Oh! Phewh! 

Vika: Booh. 

Oleg: Why are you grumbling there?

Ashley: Well, almost…

Vika: For me it’s okay. 

Oleg: Oh!

Will: Which one?

Vika: Nineteen thirty-six. 

Oleg: Nineteen thirty-six. Yes.

00:27:30:04

Salah: It’s the best point for them. Yeah. 

Oleg: Nineteen thirty-six. It’s even 10%...

Will: No water. 

Ashley: No?

Oleg: Oh, well, darn. 

Salah: Thirty-seven thirteen is the worst one?

00:28:00:23

Salah: Did you check twelve thirty-one?

Ashley: Yeah. 

Will: Twelve thirty-one?

Salah: Yeah. 

Will: Yeah. Yeah, it has a decent amount of water but…

Ashley: But it reaches, practically, like, it can sustain practically no population. 

00:28:12:18 – 00:29:10:25

[no audio]

Vika: Did we check twenty-six thirty-nine? 

Will: Twenty-six.

Vika: Thirty-nine. 

Will: So, no. 99% water loss.

Vika: Darn! 

Oleg: And what does your water loss depend on?

00:29:39:16

Oleg: You have water availability and loss. What does the loss depend on?

Will: It’s, like, it means you have two water basins where the water is contained. And, like, it leaks. And when it leaks, it’s not...within...//Well, when you...It doesn’t add water back. So, sort of...

Vika: //Not replenished…[UI]

00:30:00:04

Will: This?

Vika: Mhm. Thank you. Darn! 

Will: Fuck! 

Vika: What?

00:30:12:03 – 00:30:51:14

[no audio]

Vika: I gave a wrong answer. 

Ashley: I did that the first time.

Vika: Hm?

Ashley: I did that the first time too. 

Vika: Darn!

00:31:02:17 – 00:31:10:22

[no audio]

Ashley: Drilling specialist and mechanical engineer are on fire today. Loving it. 

00:31:19:25 – 00:31:40:10

[no audio]

Salah: So, the ranking is: Nineteen thirty-six - the first point. Then, thirty-one thirty. Then, twelve thirty-one, thirteen thirty-one and the last one – thirty-seven thirty. 

Will: Okay. So then we can…

Salah: This is the ranking. 

Will: Yeah. I told them to give us two points and then, obviously, thirty…thirty-one thirty is going to be our…On that list thirty-one thirty is gonna be [UI]. But what’s another one? What’s the next one down?

00:32:10:22

Salah: Twelve thirty-one. 

Ashley: Nope. 

Will: Twelve thirty-one. And that doesn’t work for her pretty hard,  so…

Oleg: We need to look for the result, because there are twenty minutes left – not more.

Ashley: Okay, let’s go to thirty-one thirty.

Oleg: Well, if there are too many…

00:32:37:03

Oleg: So, if the temperature is low there...

Vika: Are you looking for patterns?

Oleg: Yes. 

Vika: I chose this point randomly. 

Oleg: There, look at twenty-nine thirty-three. This, here, it seems to me, according to the algorithm that we had before, it should be there. Twenty-nine thirty-three.

00:33:03:01

Oleg: In terms of water availability, is it confirmed or not?

Will: What?

Oleg: Twenty-nine …twenty-nine thirty-three. Does the algorithm work or not? Water and sand are colder... Well, the temperature of the sand...

Will: //There’s 83% water loss. It means that there…there is water there, but not that much.

Salah: //Twenty-nine …

Ashley: //Twenty-nine thirty-three. 

00:33:30:20

Oleg: Mhm. Well, it is already…

Ashley: So what now? Shall we say then we can do thirty-one thirty?

Will: Yes. If they agree, yes. Just…

Oleg: But losses will be great. 

Salah: Mechanical engineer said, thirty-one thirty and nineteen thirty-six, I think.

Ashley: If it’s between those two…

Salah: Yeah. 

00:33:59:00

Ashley: Then thirty-one thirty is better for me. What about for everyone else?

Will: What one?

Ashley: If it was between…

Will: Yeah, I mean, that functions. I mean…

00:34:34:22 – 00:34:53:28 

[no audio]

Will: No water. 

Oleg: Then the pattern doesn’t work. 

00:35:06:04 – 00:35:51:03

[no audio]

Oleg: So what? Shall we agree to that one?

Will: They already agreed. They already added it.

Salah: Thirty-one thirty. // They agreed, yeah. 

Ashley: //Oh, they did?

Oleg: Yes. Done.

Ashley: Okay. Let’s. 

Oleg: Holy crap. It’s already…

Ashley: Darn! 

Oleg: So…

Ashley: They didn’t tell me that…

Oleg: So, thirty-one thirty, yes?

Salah: Yes. 

Oleg: Thirty-one thirty.

Ashley: So, three, two, one.

00:36:23:10 – 00:36:34:29 

[no audio]

Oleg: So, it works…[UI]

Ashley: [UI]

Will: No, thank you. 

Vika: Correct. Correct. At least…why not…

00:37:03:23 – 00:37:30:02

[no audio]

Ashley: It’s pretty low-cost. Okay. Excuse me, who the fuck put the stuff into my spaceman factor stuff? Not cool, man. Not cool. What?

Salah: They signed already, yeah?

Ashley: What is going on?

Will: I guess they are…

00:37:59:11

Will: Ah, okay, the maintenance. That was just a mistake probably. 

Vika: Boo! 

Ashley: They just did it again. 

Will: No, that’s you. 

Ashley: Oh. 

00:38:25:15 – 00:39:20:05

[no audio]

Ashley: Who keeps changing my stuff? Come on, assholes! 

Vika: What?

Ashley: Someone, literarily keeps changing what I put. Get the heck outta here. 

00:39:50:06

Oleg: Everyone inserted it?

Ashley: Almost…No! Why does the maintenance specialist keep doing this?

Oleg: Oh! 

Ashley: Oh my God. …Now I’m ready to [UI]

00:40:28:08

Ashley: And I have a survey right now. Does anyone else have a survey?

Will: Yep.

Vika: Mhm. Me too. 

Ashley: God damnit! 

Vika: I again [UI]

00:40:44:12 – 00:41:23:13

[no audio]

Oleg: So what? Ready?

Ashley: There were questionnaires. Still there, darn.

Vika: Ash, are you ready?

Ashley: I still have a freaking…

Vika: Oh. 

Ashley: Why is it taking forever?

00:41:42:04 – 00:42:06:00

[no audio]

Ashley: Alright. I’m good.

Will: Good? Everybody? Smash that “Like” button.

Oleg: Done?

Ashley: Yes. 

00:42:11:08 – 00:42:27:07

[no audio]

Oleg: It appeared and then disappeared for you. 

Vika: Mhm.

00:42:32:16 – 00:43:02:17 

[no audio]

Ashley: Did you see what they named it? “MTS party spot”.

Vika: Hm?

Ashley: Was that you?

Will: Did they name it that? Or…
